### Status Checks

None

### Presentation: Compiling Scheme to WasmGC

CLW (chat): I haven't officially joined the CG yet (will be shortly, account issues), but for context I'm the CTO at https://spritely.institute/ which is sponsoring / hosting the Scheme -> WASM effort, hence me joining this meeting :)

RT: likewise, i’m a compiler engineer at spritely institute, haven’t formally joined the CG yet but here to watch andy’s presentation

AW presenting [slides](presentations/2023-04-18-wingo-scheme.pdf)

AW: Would like to be able to read e.g. i64 out of i8 arrays.

TL: Nice to know you’re using br_on_cast. No one else is that we know of.

LA (chat): OCaml uses br_on_cast too :)

TL: How do benefit from the difference between mutable pair and pair if they are both mutable?

AW: Can cast to one or the other for reading or writing situations. It’s essentially a runtime flag telling me whether the Guile value is mutable or not. For example constants in the source are immutable. We can cast and handle failures. 

NF (chat): [About the virtualized calling convention] globals would probably not be worth it, in wasmtime at least.

BT (chat): I like this approach, as the engine has a limited number of registers it will use for the calling convention anyway

CLW (chat): \o/ tail calls in wasm!!!

CLW (chat): (delimited continuations are kinda like coroutines but you can resume them multiple times and you don't need to mark everything with async/await)

AW: Could give up multishot if we had to.

TL: Are the stacks represented as tables or arrays?

AW: Tables. There’s some question of whether to use a linear memory for unboxed values or not.

BT (chat): AFAIK the lightweight threads in the JVM now (project loom) also copy stacks into the heap

IR: What about JSPI?

AW: Is it correct that this suspends the entire Wasm module?

IR: Not the entire module, but just the current execution stack. You can use it to emulate the stack switching proposal.

AW: Can you have multiple calls of the same function?

IR: Yes.

AW: I’ll look into it. It would be great to have a call stack again.

RT (chat): "beyond relooper" paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3547621

AK: If you didn’t have stringref, what would you have done with strings?

AW: I would probably use UTF-8 buffers and have to include a bit more in the standard library. I haven’t implemented enough to know how much I would save yet. I would probably give up when getting to regex.

BT: Would you not use JS strings because of the perceived cost of accessing characters via imports?

AW: That would mostly be awkward because I would have to emit JS, which I don’t currently do. It’s nice to have everything in one module.

AW: I would also have to figure out how to emit string constants as JS strings or as data segments or something like that.

LA (chat): Did you run any benchmark to compare performances on V8 vs. native code?

AW: Not yet. Goal is to have benchmarks by August to measure against Guile and other systems.

LA (chat): Is there some kind of Guile -> JS compiler right now ?

AW: There is a stagnant one that was a result of a GSoC project.

AK: How is Guile used?

CLW: The two main Schemes are Guile and Racket. We have targeted both. One of the biggest use cases is Guix (pronounced “geeks”). Besides that there aren’t very large use cases, so Spritely is making something of a bet on it. We’re writing the next generation of distributed programming, including e.g. a time traveling [distributed debugger](https://spritely.institute/goblins/). Scheme enables building these new paradigms really easily, but we also want to run our stuff in the browser. We’re excited to be participating in this group and helping other dynamic, GC languages come to the Web.

AW (chat): spritely goblins is in some ways a successor to web standards fellow traveller mark miller (& co)'s E language

TL: I would have reached first for arrays for the virtual calling convention. Did you consider that?

AW: Yes, but thought it would be slower than globals. Maybe that’s wrong!

TL: Are you using binaryen?

AW: I was initially, but found a few annoyances with things being out of date or non-standard. Ultimately I want it to be optional.


CLW: Also want to share our updates and design docs: https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates, https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/blob/main/design/ABI.md, https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/blob/main/design/log.md, https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/tree/main/module/wasm,
https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/blob/main/module/hoot/compile.scm


### Announcement and call for feedback: [Wasmtime's proposed plan for implementing Wasm GC](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/31)

NF: Just want to say that Wasmtime plans to implement GC soon. I have an RFC up in the Bytecode Alliance RFC’s repo. The idea is that we can privately plug GC backends in and out and provide a few options. For example a general purpose GC based on MMTK, a semispace copying collector that integrates tightly with pre-reserved memory for FaaS use cases.

NF: Should I start giving status updates in this meeting?

TL: That would be great!
