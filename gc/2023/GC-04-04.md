### Status checks

TL: Conrad, were you able to do the code review Andreas was waiting on?

CW: No, have to focus on other things for the next two weeks. Will be first priority after that.

TL: Will we be able to have the spec documents done in the next three months?

CW: Maybe? It’s a problem of bandwidth if only Andreas can write them and few people can review them. Will present sometime on a research project I’m starting to make spec writing easier. It will be a DSL for writing the spec that will give us the reference interpreter for free.

TL: Sounds very cool. Maybe that’s something we would want to work on if it can help us improve the bus factor for spec work.

### Discussion: Text format field names ([#333](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/333))

CW: Even if we have globally unique field names in the custom section, you are still going to need the typing information to go from the binary format back to the named text format. Is that definitely true and I’m surprised this hasn’t come up in conversation before?

TL: That was a late stage realization. I don’t think there was a special reason it didn’t come up, just no one realized it. The format of the proposed name section is a two-level namespace so it’ll have a type index, a field index, and a name. So it does assign names to specific fields in specific types. In a hypothetical future where we have struct access instructions that don’t have a type and only a field index, even with a complete name section, say the field index is 0 and you don’t have type information, you can go through your name section and collect every single field name that is at index 0 in some type but that is going to be an arbitrarily large set of field names and without knowing about what type you are accessing, there is no way to pare down.

CW: That makes sense, but that becomes an issue in the hypothetical world where we have instructions without type annotations and now everything ties together.

TL: Right, this was a response to Andreas’s argument that a two-level namespace would have a bad debugging experience in that hypothetical future. So will single-level namespace, so it doesn’t matter.

CW: I buy it.

### Discussion: Type annotations on branching cast instructions

ML: If you specify the source type as non-nullable and the target type as nullable, is it legal? Does it compile? Is it rejected?

TL: If I remember the details of AR’s proposal, there were some number of syntactic combinations that were allowed. Eight syntactic combinations and two of them wouldn’t validate so I think that was one of the ones that wouldn’t validate.

CW: Actually in his current PR, I’m not sure they validate, I had also this thought because there are combinations that don’t make sense which I think ML is alluding to.

ML: We have flags for the target and source nullability,. Two combinations don’t make sense but there is nothing wrong with allowing them, you just lose nullability information because you used this combination that is like an up-cast on the nullability.

CW: Depends on specifics of AR’s PR which is off my memory, but I think the way he expresses the two types get combined to look at the output type even if you look at the output type as nullable if the input type is nullable the whole type becomes nullable regardless of the type. But we didn’t evaluate all the edge cases of the PR.

ML: I tried to look at the changes themselves and had issues understanding how that derives the return type. And on the issue itself, I think there was a comment about 6/8 combinations validate. But then I couldn’t find validation error in the PR or changes.

CW: I’m looking at the changes now and if you have non-null input type and a null output type annotation the output type is still non-null. The definition [here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/pull/359/files#diff-0428d866a3b1cf7a48c6da6ddaa09671223f7b44af03f4447d09bf482963e2bcR197). We shouldn’t assume thai is what the spec will say but that is what the PR says right now. 

ML: You’re referring to the diff_ref_type?

CW: I believe so, I could be misreading it but I think... Oh no, I need to think about this harder, I could be totally misreading it. That is the piece of code that needs to be understood to understand what the current PR is doing. 

TL: We can push for clarity on this issue. It’s been stagnant and I agree it’s confusing and not clear what we are going to do here.

CW: Sorry ML, I may have given an incorrect response there, but we can ask in the issue.

ML: Okay, yeah I have no idea.

TL: I found that the [corresponding prose](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/pull/359/files#diff-1df1ea4af362cad5073bac12a65046e4c21bdaa644f69e203b41687b933ac91dR636-R638), null1 is the input and null2 is the output, but yes it is confusing.

Discussion: WasmGC implementation in wasmtime

NF: I’m going to start an implementation for wasmtime soon. Q, is the most up to date place as far as the spec goes, my understanding is it’s not written, should I look at mvp.md as the main source of truth.

TL: Absolutely

AK: What about the [milestone doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DklC3qVuOdLHSXB5UXghM_syCh-4cMinQ50ICiXnK3Q/edit#heading=h.lqaesg5voz6r)?

TL: I was thinking only spec document stuff, but milestone doc is even better, thanks AK.

AK: Parallel track that engines and producers have been coordinating on.

TL: Binaryen, v8, everything else.

NF: MVP.md is getting ahead and then there is a coordinated step?

TL: Exactly, mvp.md is the canonical one, combination of where the actual implementation is going next and also when there are brand new instructions, the semantics are given in mvp.md and the binary op codes should match the milestone doc but the milestone doc is definitive as far as the implementation binary op codes go. For the implementation in wasmtime, can you share more about what you're planning? What’s the GC going to look like? What’s the implementation strategy?

NF: Are you familiar with the RFC process that wasmtime uses? I’m starting there and it’s going to have all that detail but it’s not written yet. For reference types we have a deferred reference counting implementation. We don’t mutate reference counts on the stack and use stack maps instead. I was wondering if we wanted a cycle collector, and don’t think we do. The other thing is that wasmtime is used in a lot of different production environments. Not just implementing for a browser, so I think this is going to necessitate a pluggable GC, so I’m thinking about how to define those interfaces right now. I think we’re going to have, just to get the spec tests working, a null GC that crashes on OOM. I would like to have a MMTk backend, something we can plugin. And for function-as-a-service, which a lot of embedders of wasmtime have, I am toying with the idea of a semi-space collector because it gives you fast-allocation but the 2x heap overhead is not fun. Ideally you have lots of short lived programs, so how can we have fast allocation without having fast GCs. So maybe a simple Immix mark-region thing, so we can use the full heap space rather than the semi-space thing. What’s tempting about the semi-space thing is it’s very obvious what the bookkeeping overheads are. And the way wasmtime works is you have a pooling allocator where you allocate space upfront and you divy it among the instances you want to run concurrently. And trying to think about how to statically allocate AOT the bookkeeping heap space is very easy for a semi-space collector and less simple for others.

TL: Thanks for sharing, looking forward to the RFC. Will definitely check it out.

NF: Will share once it’s ready.

ZB (chat): no-GC? :)

NF (chat): yeah, we will have one, but I don't think that will fly in production :-p

ZB (chat): why not? for short living programs, like lambdas?
