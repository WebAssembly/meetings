### Status checks

TL: I saw movement on the PR Conrad was reviewing for Andreas, how is that going and how is everything else looking?

AR: That is merged and I spent last week merging that downstream with the GC proposal, which took a while because there were lots of merge conflicts. Started trying to in the reference interpreter two different approaches to the type representation which would then end up as the spec as well. Still playing with that. Next week I’m going to start with the actual spec.

TL: Next, we have a standing PR from Conrad for the initial bulk array instructions. What. if anything, needs to happen before this lands? 

CW: That PR doesn’t include an overview or spec changes, AR I don’t know if that was your reasoning for deprioritizing it.

AR: Deprioritize it?

CW: I now realize I never formally requested you as an interviewer in GitHub’s interface.

AR: I think I did a round of review but I didn’t realize it was ready.

CW: You might be thinking about threads, this is a different PR on the repository. 

AR: I’m looking at the one Thomas just sent in chat: https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/pull/363 I see new changes that I haven’t reviewed. Send out a PTAL if you’re done with your addressing comments so reviewers know they should look again.

TL: No spec or overview changes there. AR, I’d be happy to do the overview changes if helpful.

AR: Sure.

TL: I’ll do it then.

AR: Be aware I’m out the rest of the week, will review Monday

### Discussion: Finalizing branching cast instructions ([#359](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/pull/359))

TL: Some comments on PR about using a single instruction name if we’re going to have a single base opcode for br_uncast and br_uncast_fail?. Beyond that, we haven’t discussed in detail the scheme ohere we have the base encoding and the additional byte about nullability and if it’s fail or not. Any comments on proposed encoding in this PR or should we just move forward?

BT: I don’t think the discussion reaches the conclusion about whether there should be two opcodes, one for fail, one for pass.

AR: Discussion died down.

TL: I’d like to revive it now. Personally I’m ambivalent. I’d prefer two different bytes if the encodings are shorter.

AR: To make it shorter, we’d need 6 more opcodes, which could be easily doubled in the future, which is why I went with this tentatively, it seems more scalable. We had discussed leaving extension space for more opcodes. For this one, it seems important, because I feel this will have more extensions in the future.

TL: Wish we’d done this for call instructions, seems worth learning from that.

BT: Fail versions, TL you had made the point about v8 debugging so that opcodes matched the opcode bytes. I’d prefer that because the engine generates two different versions, one is taken and one is not taken.

TL: Any strong opinions about naming?

AR: I’m trying to understand what BT is suggesting. Should we have two opcodes or one opcode and basically what Ryan? Suggested, having the immediate fail on the op code to reflect the binary op coding 

BT: Envisioning two opcodes.

AR: So changing the binary encoding. I’m fine with that, we can go either way, no strong opinions.

BT: Not high importance.

TL: If we have to choose a bikeshed color, I’d rather have two different opcodes, two different names because they do two different things. Reduce ad hoc flag immediates we have to add to things.

AR: I can make that change, SGTM.

TL: Just a matter of making changes and landing PR. Any other branch instruction changes? Alright.

### Discussion: Finalizing instruction opcodes ([#370](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/370))

TL: Haven’t thought concretely about the optimal organization, I don’t think v8 has strong opinions here, haven’t heard any internally. Anyone want to take point on developing the final opcode numbering? Any strong opinions on what it should look like?

AR: No strong opiniuons, but happy to suggest one. Are there any particular things? If anyone has anything in mind specifically we should care about, speak up now.

TL: In SIMD, we had a chart laid out nicely and we left holes for missing instructions. I don’t think that applies here, so I’m happy with whatever.

AR: Grouping with some holes for obvious anticipations, this will be straightforward.

TL: Implementations, even with final encoding, we plan to wait a bit for implementing to avoid breaking users of the origin trial. Once we’re ready to ship, end the origin trial, push the final op code reordering which will be a breaking change for everyone - phase 4.

### Discussion: Additional bulk array instructions ([#367](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/367))

TL: Last discussion is about the infinite space of potentially new bulk array instructions. Matthias was looking at bulk array instructions we can add to support growing a vector. And basically if you come up with the most general possible array allocation or copying it has an absurd number of arguments. Maybe 6 or so. So the question is what should be our design philosophy here. Should we depend on engines to depend on array copies or allocations they can optimize themselves? Or post-MVP should we add in these really complex array implementations. So that the native implementation can be maximally performant.

AR: Why is it more complicated than what we have for table bulk instructions?

TL: For tables and memories, the only instructions we have are copy, fill, init. With arrays, it gets more interesting because we have the dimension of allocating a new one at the same time or copying into a new one. Also there are more things you could be copying from, from another array, from another table, from another element segment. There are more dimensions here.

AR: That seems separate from the number of arguments thing you brought up. I don’t see why that should be worse here than.

TL: In Matthias’s suggested uber-instruction, there is a source_array, source_start_index, copy_length, target_start_index, target_length, and a default_value because you are allocating it, so anything you don’t copy needs a default value.

AR: Source and destination length I wouldn’t have. Copy or build, I think you want to separate that. I don’t think you should do that differently here.

JK: Growing backing array stores is the case where you want to copy what is there but you want to allocate more than what you are copying.

AR: I don’t think you should grow backing stores

JK: If you have a source level array, it can grow. It means when you grow in Java, you have to copy the wasm array and also grow it. And of course you can also grow it in two instructions and then copy the elements that you want. But to make it efficient you have to rely on engines removing the needless copies. Do we want to rely on engines to detect this pattern and optimize it or do we want an instruction to make this explicit?

AR: Not sure we want to address that in the MVP.

BT: This definitely sounds post-MVP to me.

TL: I agree.

CW: Looking at this issue, as a post-MVP thing, the optimized instruction with the 6 parameters doesn’t look very unreasonable to me. I think that is a very legitimate post-MVP proposal as is. Certainly if we’re considering if it’s a slippery slope, there is that matrix that Aske posted in the previous issue which shows it’s 1 of 2 gaps in our capabilities in a pretty regular way. 

NF via Chat: You also don't want to initialize new array with a default value that you then immediately overwrite

TL: Definitely was thinking of this as a post-MVP. Some concerns about slippery slope but the instruction seems reasonable, so there is probably some room to figure out the regular expressions we’ll need in this vein. We can look post-MVP.

AR: Can you clarify what you have in mind for MVP?

TL: Bulk array instructions exactly mirror table and memory bulk instructions. Init, two kinds, init_elem and init_data for the two different kinds of segments. Then we have copy and fill. And that’s it. 

AR: Copy is array to array?

TL: Yes, all non-allocating. Separately, we had new_data and new_elem as well as new_fixed for taking values off of the stack. We have not filled out a regular chart of instructions but we have some nice subcharts if you will. 

TL: Any other things to discuss while we’re all here? Next meeting is a presentation from Intel about compiling a subset of TS to WasmGC.
