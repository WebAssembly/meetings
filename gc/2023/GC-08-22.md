### Status Checks

TL: For Binaryen, things are going well, we are implementing new optimizations for WasmGC. We landed a patch that lets you opt in to the final binary encoding at build time. So you define a macro and it uses the final encoding. We have PRs ready to go as soon as we hit Phase 4 to switch to the final encoding by default, at which point you’d still be able to opt into the legacy encoding. Assuming launch is looking good. We have a PR to remove the legacy encoding entirely as well. There is an open issue about br_on_cast where we previously decided to allow br_on_cast to have the output type to be not necessarily related to the output type, but after further discussion with AR, we came to the conclusion it would be nice to restrict it so that br_on_cast is restricted to in fact a downcast, enforced by the validator. Found a very simple way to work around that restriction in Binaryen. No concerns here, but would be interested in other concerns. Already closed the issue as there wasn’t conversation on it. We can talk about the text format next. Any other status?

TL: My impression is V8 is good to go. I know Jakob had a patch for binary encoding for V8 as well.

JK: We haven’t introduced a build time flag because a few people compile on V8 and that doesn’t make sense for us. But we have prepared the patch and are ready to go after the Phase 4 vote. Is on my TODO to run the spec tests again, I haven’t gotten to that yet.

TL: Sync some time and run the Binaryen fuzzer with the updated opcode and V8, see if anything happens. I’ll take an AI for this. Any other status?

TL: RH emailed me (he’s not here). Moving on to the next agenda item, issue about using open instead of final in the text format. RH says that it should be ready to go and is just awaiting review by AR. SGTM. We only have a few days after AR comes back from vacation before the Phase 4 vote, but I think that’s okay and we can make it happen. Just want to make everyone aware of the issue and onboard with the change to the text format. JK, is there a plan to update the disassembler V8 uses?

JK: We’ll have to. Shouldn’t be hard I hope.

TL: Similarly, Binaryen hasn’t updated the text format yet. Still places we’re using the old experimental text format that’s not standard, but that kind of describes all of Binaryen’s text format. Not worried. Will do work to update Binaryen’s text format but it is not the highest priority. Scheduling-wise, we have a Phase 4 vote for Sep 12, 2023, AR is on vacation thru the end of August and then will be at ICFP from September 4 – 9th. So we have 3 days for AR to do spec reviews before the Phase 4 vote but I think it will be okay. If everyone is onboard with the text change, that brings us to the end of our agenda. As expected, rather light. Anything else?

TL: See you in a week for pre-announcing the Phase 4 vote at the CG meeting, then we’ll probably meet again before the Phase 4 vote.
