JK presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OxU3lrgtyo1b5HaF55Vk0lzk3BlJshaRADKX87hH7bE)

CW: Looks wonderful. Can you walk me through why option 2 for i31ref would require boxing?

JK: Would normally represent a 42 in JS the same as we would represent an i31ref 42, so if we need to distinguish them, one needs to be boxed.

AR: Wanted to ask about that. Do you know in V8 which operations might produce non-canonical numbers?

JK: Definitely divisions, which assumes the result has a fraction. Also pulling numbers out of arrays.

AR: Another question: What about minus 0?

JK: Right, and we couldn’t convert it here because extern.{extern,internalize} are supposed to be value preserving.

CW: Do we need to think about what the semantics of calls if we allow more types on the boundary are?

JK: We would have to do the same work as part of the function call sequence.

AR: Would have to build the internalize logic and downcast into the call.

BT: I think what we have here is fine for shipping, but what about once we get ecosystem penetration and get more modules that use GC types on the boundary? Can we relax that?

JK: Yes, which restriction were you thinking about?

AR: I think it’s critical that we allow anyref at the boundary. Externref specifically means host reference, and there are uses for that, but the more dominant use case is that if you import something, you don’t want to commit to whether it comes from Wasm or the host. If you don’t have anyref, then you can’t do that in a way that would be efficient for linking to other Wasm code. The cost of converting to externref just at the boundary would be unacceptable.

JK: I can see futures where we may need that and it may be a common case. But no one does that now. The MVP use case is a single module app that talks to the browser. I do believe this intentional.

AR: That’s too minimal. If we don’t allow it now, people will use the wrong abstraction and there will be confusion later.

RH: But you can still use this to link Wasm modules together with no conversion by opaquely passing through JS.

AR: Still, it’s important to be able to implement the other side in JS. That’s a general goal of WebAssembly.

CW: I agree, but also conscious that JK said it would be a lot of engineering work. Can you share more? Could it be implemented before shipping?

JK: I would prefer not to block shipping on this. It seems really low priority. No one is using this. Can still stitch Wasm modules together, just not call them from JS.

BT: Can dynamically generate modules to do the translation. You would need to be able to reflect on signatures to determine when that was necessary.

AR: That would be tedious and have a lot of overhead to do all that wrapping.

BT: I 90% agree with Andreas and 10% agree with Jakob. I share the concern about self-fulfilling prophecy.

JK: Would be a quick follow-on proposal to relax this.

BT: No such thing as a quick follow-on so far.

AR: If it’s quick, we can just do it now. Won’t be shipping MVP this year, so not much difference between 3 weeks and 3 months to implement this.

TL: Would this be similarly complicated in other engines?

RH: Would have to think about it more. Are there spec concerns about this or just engineering timing? It seems like we’re just speculating about what’s going to take longer.

CW: On the spec side this would be trivial. It think it would be fine for V8 to defer implementing it for months and months. Would be fine with aiming to have it and making a crunch time decision when it comes to shipping.

RH: Won’t be trivial in SpiderMonkey. Don’t know if it’s a week or a month, but not having this would make things strictly easier.

AT (chat): I think we don’t have a good idea of how much work it would be (anyref on boundary) in JSC work either at the moment

JM: If it’s going to be slow to pass other types, people will want to use externref anyway. Better to spend engineering time on other things.

BT: The performance concern is specific to JS and in the long run of Wasm, passing anyref on boundaries will not be a problem. Need to optimize for API ergonomics.

AR: Also don’t want to bifurcate the ecosystem between externref passers and anyref passers.

AK: Part of the reason we want to take the minimal approach to JS interop is that we don’t have people trying to do rich things between JS and Wasm. The idea of transparently swapping between JS and Wasm is future looking. What would be a use case for that?

BT: Once you have a data structure like a high-performance hash map. Could be implemented in either language.

AR: There’s the general polyfill class of usecases where you want to implement in one or other to provide functionality before it becomes available.

BT: In my VMs class right now we have an extension that wouldn’t be implementable with anyref for the reasons here.

AR: Just to step back a little, we are in broad agreement about the minimal functionality here and this one detail seems like a relatively minor point in comparison.

RH: If you have an exported global with a concrete type and you do a global.set from JS, is there an implicit cast there?

JK: Yes, and the difference from function calls is that it’s less performance sensitive and easier to implement than in the function call case.

RH: And there’d be a similar mechanism for tables?

JK: Right. If someone wanted to, we could make that more restrictive.

RH: For the implicit cast, was there concern about what RTTs to use?

JK: That concern still holds and in a future with arbitrary RTTs we would have to add something else or tell people to work around it on their own.

AR: Ryan makes a good point there. I think there’s a strong case for making them consistent there. It’s strange if you can pass a type in one way but not the other.

JK: If you need a principled argument, it’s because functions give you a place to add the instructions yourself. Globals and tables need to be implicit because there is nowhere explicit to put the instructions.

CW: In the fullness of time when all signature are allowed, implicit casts will be the only reasonable semantics.

BT: Would need a special case of the `toWebAssemblyValue` algorithm that throws for function calls.

RH: Is there any thought on what type reflection should look like? Inspecting or constructing tables for specific types, for instance.

JK: Our working assumption is that this is just not possible, since the interaction with isorecursive type canonicalization is complicated.

AR: You’re asking what .type would do?

CW: IIUC it would just throw right now?

RH: No, since this is functionality added in the separate type reflection proposal.

JK: That’s a good question.

AK (chat): https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-types/blob/main/proposals/js-types/Overview.md#type-representation

AR: Maybe throwing would make sense if the type cannot be reflected into JS yet. Or maybe generalizing to `func` from specific function types? But no, that would be bad.

AT: There are other cases where things similar to type reflection come up, like in creating globals. Can you create a null ref of any for instance?

AR: I think that would be disallowed for now.

JK: JS has one null value that you could pass in.

BT: The JS null would have to be internalized. For type reflection, would probably want something to expose and construct rec groups.

RH: That makes sense, but I’m concerned about how we would handle JS object identity with the canonicalization. Happy to have a shortcut for the MVP.

AR: In the current reflection API, function types are syntactic and not canonicalized if I remember correctly. Does it return the same object for the same type?

RH: Don’t think so. It may be underspecified.

AR: We could choose to have the object identity reflect canonicalization or not.

BT: …

JK: I think the types are weakrefs so if you keep creating and destroying modules, we won’t run out of memory.

MK: That’s right, they’re weak.

AT: So are we planning not to extend the existing type grammar in JS for now?

JK: But tables and globals can hold arbitrary ref types. We should make that explicit in the spec.

BT/AR: That already follows from globals holding value types and tables holding ref types.

AT: What about that same functionality in JS?

RH: To clarify, you’re thinking about that WebAssembly.Global constructor from JS and passing in some interesting type there.

AT: Yeah, and the typed function references proposal extends that with a ref type constructor.

JK: Would need an API for rec groups.

AT: What about for `eq` and `array` and other GC types that don’t need rec groups?

RH: I would support supporting those.

AR: Would prefer to consistently allow or disallow the same types/values everywhere.

CW/RH/TL/AT: Thank you to Jakob for the doc and presentation.
