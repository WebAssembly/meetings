### Discussion: Alternatives to `let` (https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/issues/44)

JK: (Summary of findings posted on GitHub issue.) Seeing compile time improvement with implemented no-annotation option because code size decrease offsets cost of inference.

CW: It looked like 20% of control flow blocks propagated information. After Alon’s latest post it seems that the tracking could track lots of locals that will never be used again. Annotations could save that work.

JK: Yes, but that should happen rarely.

BT: Question about implementation.

JK: Pseudocode on the github issue.

BT: If there’s an annotation, then you don’t need an undo stack, or do you?

ASC: Would still need the undo stack since the annotation doesn’t give you the state from before the block.

JK: In the case of a non-defaultable local initialized in a nested block then never used again, the annotation could save some work. OTOH, the initialization is very cheap.

CW: But Alon, you found that this was common, right?

AZ: Yes, at least in the current Java toolchain.

ASC: Temporary locals would cause this pattern as well.

AR: I would also assume this is a common case because compilers generate lots of locals.

TL: Hypothetically, could we be comfortable moving forward without annotations if that’s what further data shows is faster?

CW: Would still want to see a fairly large difference to introduce the inconsistency.

BT: Would this affect multiloops?

CW: Think multiloops could work either way.

TL: If annotations are meant to improve performance, I don’t see how you can argue to have them even if they decrease performance.

AR: There’s also future-proofness. For example in the past type inference would have been simple, but it isn’t any more so it’s good we have block types.

JK: Example of try blocks having to be treated conservatively.

ASC: This arose as a complication in Binaryen, which had a more precise control flow graph. Moving non-nullable locals into try blocks broke validation of locals.

CW: That seems to slightly lessen the argument that not having annotations makes things simpler for producers, since they have to do this extra work anyway.

BT: This is a question of priority. Performance or consistency?

CW: Hopefully both.

TL: Sounds like the clear path forward is to prototype annotations.

AZ: I am worried about the worst case scenarios where a single initialization causes N annotations due to deeply nested blocks.

AR: We’ve already swallowed that cost for block types.

AZ: I’ve never seen a large stack of blocks with result types.

AR: That’s because C wouldn’t have them, but other languages might.

BT: We can try to come up with a dense encoding of the bitmaps using e.g. run length encoding and LEBs.

KM: Sounds similar to what you would with ARM.

BT: Similar to how compilers group locals by type to take advantage of run length encoding of locals.

AR: This adds another dimension to the problem, but in principle is similar.

JK: Please suggest something concrete so we can prototype it.

AR: Will do.

LW: Can we take advantage of nesting to have blocks inherit information from outer blocks?

AR: Could also factor out block types into a shared section and use just an index.

JK: Another idea is to have two modes, one with a list of locals and one that inherits the parent block’s initialization.

AR: Instead of extending the type section, we could add something to the mini local declaration section inside each function.

BT: We should also consider adding zero bytes to type definitions as well for extensibility.

LW: … Iterating on the idea of having the local effects as part of function types in the type section. It might be more generally useful if we have pluggable inline caches or similar in the future.

### Discussion: Split externref out (https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/307)

AR: Could be annoying if every module has to choose whether it’s going to optimize for the host or Wasm representation.

TL: Agree policy question is tricky, but much better to put it in the hands of the toolchain rather than baking some arbitrary policy into the engine.

JK: It’s making costs more explicit since all the conversions and checks need to happen anyway.

AR: We’re trading complexity for some performance wins that might be relatively specific to the JS API. Not sure the complexity is worth it.

CW: Probably won’t show up in C API, but could show up in other embeddings with dynamic languages.

AR: The special case this is dealing with is where the host and Wasm heaps are shared. Other embeddings might assume some wrapping and unwrapping anyway.

JK: It’s more than just one check, too. Could add more differences in the future, making this a long if-else chain just to pass pointers around without having to look at it explicitly.

LW: An externref is kind of like a lazy internref. Source can try to keep it opaque as late as possible.

BT: When you re-wrap it, there’s an expectation that you get the same identity, so it has to have pointers internally.

MK: Already doing that for functions.

AR: Not sure you would want to do that for structs or arrays.

JK: Depends on how the JS API evolves. Currently plan is to not change representation on boundary for structs or arrays, but depending on future requirements we might need an object-object pair.

CW: Would like to settle this discussion and freeze the type hierarchy soon. It blocks other issues every time it comes up.

TL: Agree, we should thoroughly investigate the options for the current discussion and then settle it for real.

BT: +1, we’ve been holding the door open to changes here for a while. We should finish it.

AR: We should either keep the representation universes separate (with 3 different bottom types) or combine them.

BT: We can decide about whether funcrefs should be separate based on empirical data, and if it is worth splitting out, we can just keep all three separate.

ASC: If we solve the boundary problem by keeping externref types separate, do we still need funcref to be separate, though? That was solving the same problem.

JK: Yes, If we have these lazy extern types, then the performance problem with func <: any would be solved.

LW: There were some other optimization ideas that func </: any would allow, but no one is working on them now.

TL: What experiments are we trying to run?

CW: Seems that the only experiment would be try to show that the cost of implicit checks is not that bad. Ben was suggesting experiments for func <: any, but externref seems more fundamental.

BT: it’s still useful data though.

TL: Part of the problem is that J2CL currently doesn’t pass a lot of data across the boundary, so that will be hard to measure. Maybe we can do something with Dart?

AR: That sounds like a useful data point, too. If J2CL doesn’t pass much across the boundary, then maybe it doesn’t matter too much?

JK: No, that’s temporary and reducing the boundary surface was an explicit goal to get things going. More will be passed across the boundary in the future.
