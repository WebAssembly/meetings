### Discussion

AR: Two constraints: uniform representation for internal and external references and also representation of different values must not overlap across intern and extern. That second constraint only matters for unboxed values, since boxed values are trivially disjoint.

AR: Titzer (not present) had argued that we need empirical data that keeping the types separate is useful.

JK: I would flip that around and say we need data to support having the uniform representation.

LW: Agree, all engines would have to change slightly to support the uniform representation. Wouldn’t want to have any performance consequence for the convenience of the spec. I think someone already proposed this.

AR: I proposed the option of keeping all of intern, extern, and func separate, since if we’re ok with any separation, we might go all in.

CW: Difference is that extern and intern mirror what modules already have to do on the boundary. There will be a class of hosts that could avoid work on the boundary even if not all hosts would be able to, and we should reflect that in the type system.

TL: If we go with the solution with three separate groups, are there any immediate problems we would run into?

CW: There might be some danger about breaking case analysis by moving func under anything.

JK: I thought we had consensus that the current func was unlikely to be directly usable and that we might add something like closure ref in the future. So I’m not worried about making unsafe changes to the current func.

AR: Would be unfortunate in practice if we introduced a new incompatible func type and old APIs became incompatible.

TL: Any objections to moving forward with the three separate types?

AR: I slightly prefer the uniform representation design, but I’m ok with this as well.

JK: For JS API, we could mandate use of extern rather than intern on the JS boundary.

AR: That would be bad for composability.

CW: Would work, but you’d need a wrapper module giving extern type signatures for use on the Web.

AR: Already went over why you want to use `intern` (we should call it `any`) wherever you’re not absolutely sure you’re dealing with an external value.

CW: Agree that we should do conversions on JS boundary. Unfortunate that `any` wouldn’t include `func`.

JK: Will have to think about it more offline, but maybe we can have lazy externref to avoid extra conversion costs.

AR: Would have to pull the laziness down into the intern type, which is not what you want.

CW: Agree in principle, but we can’t stop engines from doing whatever they think is fastest.

AT: If we go with the three-prong design, when we extend it, would we expect new types to go under the intern type? For example, with stringref, would it go under extern because it’s more of an external thing?

JK: Would expect that to be an internref with easy conversion to externref.

AR: Extern would always be completely opaque.

JK: As a corollary, we will never have subtypes of extern.

AR: Could actually have subtypes to constrain which internal references the extern references are extern versions of.

LW: Also for type imports we will want T <: extern.

CW: There has been some chatter about how externref will help with DOM interaction. Between that and stringref, how close are we to “solving” the DOM interaction problem.

LW: Need a way to pass receivers and a way to create typed array views without calling out to glue.

AR: Wouldn’t you want a way to access DOM objects as well?

LW: Imported functions solve that. Just need to “unwrap” the DOM function inside the JS wrapper. For example, when importing sin we can call it directly without going through JS because the signatures match up. There could be some JS API for configuring this (and it could also tie into JS promise integration).

AR: Why wouldn’t this work for strings as well?

CW: You want to munge strings from Wasm.

LW: Order of magnitude difference: string operations should be a few machine instructions, DOM calls may be more involved. Feels like a difference in kind.

FM: The WebAssembly JS Types is owned by Till, but he’s not active. The JS API Luke was talking about is potentially useful for stack switching, but it would depend on this phase 2 JS type proposal. We need someone to pick it up.

V8 and SM both implement but do not ship WebAssembly.Function

DG: Background: we tried to find a new champion, but until very recently there was no pressing use case. With compelling reasons we can find a new champion and push it forward.

AT (chat): IIRC type reflection is also missing a story on how it will integrate with types funcrefs and typedefs in general.

YS: I volunteer to champion JS types, but could use some help.

DG: I can help.

TL: To recap, we have consensus to move forward with the three-prong solution. We can revisit once we have very concrete user feedback, but it should be a high bar. Next discussions are about `wasm` type that Ben wanted, specifics of casting and conversion discussions.

JK: Also bikeshedding type names.
