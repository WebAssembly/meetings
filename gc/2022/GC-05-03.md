### Discussion: Bringing back `nullref` [#288](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/288) [10 minutes]

CW: If we bring back nullref, is there value in keeping typed nulls around.

TL: Can't get rid of them, they're part of the shipped reference types proposal.

TL: On the issue, there was discussion of whether we should add a new instruction…

BT: Depends on the bottom heap type question

AR: Not sure this is the best forum to discuss, as it's super-technical.
Having bottom heap type is the only reasonable design. Have to keep the general shape of types uniform. The non-null (ref bot) is necessary because if you don’t have it, you lose principle typing and other things.

CW: We could have an ad hoc forbidding of…

AR: No, then you lose subtype substitutability… (explanation)

BT: Could substitute something that produces unreachable

CW: An unreachable type is exactly an uninhabited type.

AR: ref bottom is uninhabited but importantly also a ref type. A non-ref bottom type wouldn’t work.

BT: Two subtype relationships going on, value types and heap types. We already need a bottom value type. When working on Jawa, I ended up adding a bottom type…

CW: I'm compelled by the argument that we want the shape to be uniform to simplify the casting rules. 

AR: We definitely don’t want a discontinuity in the type system, even if we could pull it off. The effects are unpredictable.

BT: Inline structs wouldn’t work as well.

AR: Inline structs would be a different class ("defined type") of type alongside value type and heap type, so we wouldn’t have a bottom type for those. Reference types introduce some special cases in validator for unreachable code, but I think that’s independent of whether we have a bottom heap type. Where else would there be a special case?

BT: Anywhere in the format you could write a heap type, you could type bottom. For example in br_on or br_on_not.

AR: The proposed refactor of those instructions syntactically restricts to subset of heap types, would disallow bottom as well. Definitely don’t want to allow arbitrary heap types to be used with the cast instructions.

TL: What's wrong with a bottom heap type on a cast?

AR: It'll always fail

TL: Seems fine

AR: Well that's totally useless, I don't think we should allow such

TL: Would be nice to allow arbitrary heap types, even if some are useless

AR: But you already can't allow casting to eq

JK: Why would it be bad to cast to eq?

AR: Because eq might include host-defined types and it could be arbitrarily expensive to check for that.

CW: What’s the state of externref/anyref?

TL: They are the same type now.

CW: So we already have the case where external types and Wasm types have to be differentiated. If systems are set up to support that, then it could make the system even more regular.

AR: Worried that if we make the type hierarchy richer later, unneeded generality could cause issues, e.g. extra work for engines.

CW: Could be a tooling hazard where modules disagree about producing anyref or eqref and can’t compare them. Can’t compose those modules if you can’t cast to eqref.

AR: Why would you have that mismatch?

CW: Because you don't control the module

AR: But then how do you know it'll work?

CW: You don't, but would like an operation that will succeed or trap

JK: Checking for data is no worse than checking for eq from an engine perspective. 

AR: Could imaging adding more types to eq, and each time the check gets more expensive. Same thing could happen with data, but that is a more closed set, so it’s less risky. Overall it would be good to have more specific casting instructions to avoid preventing ourselves from adding more types in the future because casts would become too expensive.

CW: Don't want to create a situation where modules try to cast to a variety of types until it gets the right one, then expose it as eqref.

BT: If you’re using type erasure to implement polymorphism, then you always end up with the supertype statically and have to insert downcasts. In the limit that means we need casts to reverse every subsumption in the system.

AR: When I implemented a compiler that did that, I just used eqref instead of anyref and that was sufficient.

BT: Then your code wasn’t truly polymorphic. It was only polymorphic up to eq. If there’s a library that produces anyref, then that would be insufficient.

AR: We're basically talking about host types, and there's no way to know whether they even support equality

BT: When you implement type erasure (example from Java)

CW: Can we leave the ability to generalize until later?

AR: Sure, that's what I would prefer to do

ASC: Something close to this is happening with Wasm/JS interop

JK: I don’t think we have specified that JS references are all eqref.

AR: JS docs are super stale, but I remember discussing this, maybe with Luke? This was going to be a problem with numbers, but we concluded that it was doable and not a big issue.

JK: The question is whether pointer equality is meaningful, and that’s not always the case for JS.

AR: But JS objects specifically can be eqref, right?

JK: Sure, if we specify it that way.

LW: If you import a host object as anyref and want it to interop with your type erased system, then that’s a good reason to erase to anyref rather than trying to wrap it.

AR: Still seems like you either know things are equatable or that they’re not.

CW: No one has objected to having casts of the form `ref.cast <HeapType>`, we’re just quibbling over which heaptypes to allow there. Any objections to going with that?

BT: I’m not convinced back compat is that easy. Adding types and subtyping is fraught. You would be able to determine what version of the spec you’re on. For example subtyping between function types in the future.

### Discussion: RTTs [#275](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/275) [25 minutes]

TL: Concern is hidden costs in the future having to do implicit passing around of type info, outside control of the toolchain. Comes up especially with generics.

AR: Cost of generics are main motivation, there are other use cases, customising object creation as discussed before, or e.g. extensions similar to constant fields like with the hidden classes JS engines have.

TL: If we keep RTTs explicit, in the future I'd be hesitant to make changes to them that would inhibit the optimizability of casts. E.g., making RTTs generative would have this problem, as you could no longer make use of the static types to do optimizations.

AR: Agreed, I think we should make that a design goal for RTTs. For generative types, rtt.fresh isn't the way we should go.

JK: My general opinion is that we should add features when we can use them. I can see future uses for RTTs, but not in the MVP. We currently have implemented both RTT-consuming and non-RTT versions of every instruction, so this is not a maintenance burden. Also there are bad interactions with the host when values are passed back from JS to Wasm, where we have to “guess” the RTT to use to cast the value back to a Wasm type. Debugging and other interactive use cases depend on being able to pass values across the boundary without toolchain preparation.

AR: First, I'd argue that dynamic interaction with Wasm is far-fetched, given how static Wasm is.

JK: It’s not far-fetched. DevTools needs this right now.

AR: Still don't want to restrict Wasm's design based on such dynamic requirements. More generally, these sorts of worries are exactly why I think we should include RTTs now, so that we don't go off in a direction that won't support them even though they'll be needed for things we know we want to add, like generics. Just because we've slimmed down the MVP to a small set of features doesn't mean that we won't want to add more stuff later; this is why I called removing RTTs creating "a hole" in the proposal.

BT: One concrete thing we’ve talked about is the ability to piggyback source level casts, and I don’t see how to do that even in the MVP.

TL: You can’t piggyback. You need pure user-level RTTs followed by the lower-level cast.

AR: The reasonable thing we can do is have generative types, which would help with the first level of cast functionality. Would still need user-level cast implementation for anything beyond Java classes, but that’s ok.

BT: I would posit that it’s reasonable to require that a Java cast can be piggybacked.

AR: All Java casts? They include array casts, which generative types don't help with.

AR: Think there's too much focus on Java; yes, it's important, but its casts are also weird in some ways.

BT: Given that Wasm requirements are based on the languages we need to support, and that Java-like classes are used by many languages, it seems a fair requirement.

LW: Backing up a bit, can’t we view the static types as if they implicitly had an rtt.canon built in, and in the future we could add RTTs and the current instructions would be reinterpreted as using canonical RTTs.

AR: Sure, but then you end up a lot of redundancy later on.

TL: We already have this redundancy in V8 and Binaryen and it's not that bad.

CW: Would want to hear more about JK’s DevTools requirements.

JK: In order to debug a module, you want to be able to interactively call a function to produce an object and then pass it to a different function. Since this is interactive, it’s not statically typed, so we have to automatically perform the correct casts.

AR: The host can track objects' types in that environment. It can annotate every object with the type it is returned at and check against that when passing it. That would be most general and completely independent of Wasm internals like RTTs.

LW: Aren’t the devtools written in JS, so the thing that has to do this is the JS API?

JK: If the JS API handles this, then great. It’s possible that the JS API is more restrictive than what DevTools needs.

LW: Seems like the same kind of check.
