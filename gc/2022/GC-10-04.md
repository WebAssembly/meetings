### JS

YS: I offered to work on the JS side a few months ago but haven’t gotten to it.

TL: Jakob has been working on MVP minimal interop, will need more later.

AK: I believe Yulia is referring to the unrelated JS types proposal https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-types.

### Discussion: Deferring i31 to post-MVP ([#320](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/320))

TL presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f7jc82JxvuW8krsyCGr5q8revL8rVYLHXr32ihSL5mU/edit?usp=sharing)

BT: I would say that OCaml counts as a production language.

TL: Agree if folks were working on it.

PC (Chat): Leo and I are working on this (OCaml) already. The current version of i31 works well, but don’t have performance numbers. Getting numbers by comparing to boxing all integers would be too much work.

TL: News to me, would be great to hear more about this. If you could post an issue with your experience, that would be great.

BT: Want to avoid self-fulfilling prophecy where people don’t use it because we don’t include it.

AR: Talked to OCaml folks and they are waiting for the proposal to settle. Agree about self-fulfilling prophesy.

FM: Which is the more important use case, representing small integers or uniform representation?

AR: Both.

FM: But Aske’s experiments use it as an optimization.

AR: I think that’s a more advanced use case.

BT: Agree. And would want additional instructions to support that use case.

ASC: Yes, those are the kind of instructions I suggested.

AR: To be clear, they are useful, but that’s the part that we should push to the MVP because it’s less clear to me what we need there.

BT: I generally agree with Andreas. Given that interface types will have variants as a primitive, they will need to be able to implement those efficiently.

AR: The only runtime I have worked on that used tagging for small integer optimizations was V8.

FM: I don’t think the IT consideration is relevant because the interface types are not materialized.

BT: They’re lowered?

FM: Yes, but not materialized. My reading is that there was a misunderstanding of what i31 was for.

BT: This is really a space optimization to avoid boxing when you have the union of a small scalar and pointer.

AR: Also a time saving from avoiding allocation, I hope.

TL: AR mentioned in the past that i31 as currently specced would be compatible with future addition of unions.

AR: They're orthogonal. Unions would be a union over heap types, it'd just work out. As to ASC's use-case I don't see why we couldn't add such instructions in the future.

CW: To echo what I said before, introducing a union type that is i31-or-something

TL: That's the i31-as-type-dimension discussion?

CW: Yes

TL: Are we concerned about weirdness where i31 appears in multiple places: as a heap type, and also as a separate item in this union list?

CW: …

AR: We could have a step where a union has a heap type and an i31, and then generalize from there.

CW: If it was between that and having i31 as a type dimension, I would choose this halfway step.

BT: externalize and internalize are nops in Wizard. That will be observable once we have unions. (note taker missed details about casts making this observable)

AR: This is why I think it's bad to be able to cast to any type. For this reason and others, it's not gonna scale.

ASC: Want branching instructions to perform sharpening. That’s key to the benefit from unions in the i31 optimization case.

AR: A union would be defined as an ordered list in the type section (ordered to avoid quadratic costs), and casts would only be able to strip the last type in the list to perform sharpening. Compilers would have to be careful in how they compose types, but it would make for good performance.

CW: Is the problem of casting an arbitrary type to a union worse than casting a struct that contains a union?

AR: Yes, because the struct has its own type definition that does not depend on the contents. For subtyping on unions, if it’s the ordered thing, it’s not very useful for casts. Might still need a quadratic number of checks. Won’t scale. The property would be that a value never has union type, so it might be linear.

BT: Right, no dynamic union types, so the value only has a single type info on it.

ASC: Could simulate cast to union with a block where the target type is a union and have a sequence of checks.

TL: Would love to hear more from OCaml about whether i31 works for them. For post-MVP it sounds like we may want to add more things like ASC has suggested.


BT: On the subject of having it as a dimension, I think it would be ok if we end up having redundant ways of using/specifying i31 as a trade off to get it into the MVP.

JM: Couldn’t find literature about “type dimensions.” Is there another phrase?

AR: It’s basically something we came up with, since nullability (or i31ness) is independent of what the heap type is.

CW: I’d be very happy if we never added any other type dimensions, since it affects every single heap/reference type.

AR: Agree, and also it doesn’t match how it’s needed in practice, since it’s needed in union.

ZB (chat): Can we do something like ref i32 and depend on small value optimizations?

TL: This was discussed in one of the issues. It’s too unpredictable for Wasm.

AR: In particular we don’t want implicit allocations.

JK: We speculatively inline call_ref based on type feedback, but not with deopts. We may add them eventually.

CW: I remember that you previously said it could apply to call_indirect as well. Has that happened?

JK: We’ve thought about it, but haven’t implemented it yet. There’s not a high priority. One issue is with type canonicalization and function subtyping.

AR: IIRC, the proposal as currently written has function subtyping, but not for call_indirect.

JK: My understanding is that it’s intentionally conservative and we would like to find a way to lift that restriction without regressing performance.

AR: I think the best thing to do if you want to check subtying in call_indirect would be to have a fast path that checks equivalence and a slow path that checks subtyping.

BT: Don’t you know statically that there are no subtypes?

AR: No, because some other module might have defined a subtype of the intended signature and passed a function in.

BT: (more details)

CW: Question for Aske: does that change to use function subtyping also depend on it in call_indirect?

ASC: No, we’re using covariant subtyping in struct definitions.

BT: I think Java doesn’t need function subtyping because it requires generates bridge methods when overrides change types. Virgil does have this subtyping in both parameters and returns, but it generates bridges and would need the full generality and would need func.bind to attach function types from a different hierarchy.

ASC: Dart also has variance in both arguments and returns. But for call_indirect, still need some signature on the call site. Could use the most specific type, but you don’t generally have it at the caller.

AR: Wouldn’t it be the other way around? The annotation would be the most general type and the function that gets called could end up being a subtype of that.

ASC: Think you’re right. Could take LUB of all functions that could appear.

AR: Another option is to keep call_indirect as it is now, and it could be emulated with table.get + downcast + call_ref. Don’t know if an engine could get that as fast.

CW: Question would be whether it would be faster or smaller in the engine to do that or to support generalized subtyping in call_indirect.

BT: Fast path to check signature ID in table entry might save one instruction maybe.
