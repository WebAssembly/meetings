### Discussion: RTTs ([#275](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/275)) [30 minutes]

BT presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fL4-NwjpiiQ4PPQt3adGNH5rDiZFJFs-gH2apC-Wdxc/edit#slide=id.g130629fc726_0_60) about programmable meta-objects / RTTs.

AR: Metaobject idea is not new: static fields have been [listed](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Post-MVP.md#static-fields) in the post-MVP for a while. The new thing is the second kind of cast. Seems like there’s no conflict between the different kinds of casts, but we have details to explore. Regardless, plain Wasm casts cannot be rtt-free with generics. 

LW: Totally agree on the meta-object thing. I also buy the software engineering argument that we should design it together with RTTs and therefore delay them from the MVP.

BT: Currently, when declaring an RTT type you can declare an index. In the future we’d want to declare fields there too. Might want a zero field too.

AR: Spent some time thinking about how we would do this. Both ways involve extending the struct definition. So we would need a new mechanism on the type level, otherwise you don’t know at runtime what static fields you can access. Could either ad hoc let any struct also have static fields, or you could let metaobjects be declared separately and even have their own metaobjects.

BT: This is why I think we should have a functioning version of that before we ship anything related to RTTs.

AR: In the model I had in mind, you have two ways of creating an RTT: rtt.canon if you don’t care about the metobject, or by getting an rtt from a declared metaobject via a new instruction.

BT: That sounds reasonable, but the devil’s in the details. Depends how you refer to RTTs, load from them etc.

AR: That’s why you want metaobjects of metaobjects, i.e. metaobjects can have rtts.

BT: Until we have it prototyped and used, I’d worry that we’d miss a detail. So doing this all in post-MVP makes sense to me. The primary cost is that we’d duplicate the rtt-free instructions in the future.

AR: The primary cost I see is on the risk side. RTTs right now aren’t a feature but a design choice, and a fundamental one at that. The risk I see is that if we leave them out, people might make assumptions about the design (e.g., how casts work under the hood), and we could find ourselves in the position that they couldn’t be added. I see the point that they are not “useful” right now, but if you see them as a design choice rather than a feature, then that makes more sense.

TL: There must be RTTs internally, even in MVP. In MVP, these are simple static lookups because allocation and cast targets are always known statically and there is a bounded number of types. Once we add generics, the number of types will be unbound and cast targets will not be statically known, so the engine will have to pass RTTs around. any implicit MVP-passing scheme would have overhead even where unnecessary, e.g. in generic containers. To avoid that overhead, we will want explicit RTT values to pass around and elide if possible. I like all the metaobject stuff, and agree that software engineering wise it’d be best to design it all together, but even aside from that I think we will have RTTs. All things considered, delaying from the MVP seems like the right choice.

AR: Since we agreed we need them for generics and type imports, part of the risk I see is that those features are delayed until we resolve RTTs. With Ben’s argument that we should codesign with metaobjects, that risk increases.

JK: I’m quite firmly in the postpone camp, by the principle that we should only add features that are used by producers and provide value at the time they’re used. We already have RTTs in the engine. That’s why I’m not concerned about risk. We have people here who are care about efficiently implementable casts, so I don’t expect the group to make mistakes here in the future. I like Ben’s ideas about metaobjects. I can see that maybe even in the future we may be able to do some static configuration instead of RTTs, but that remains to be seen. I’m not worried about the risk of not being able to add them in the future. Especially because V8’s Map objects, which are the implementation equivalent to RTTs, aren’t going anywhere.

BT: One last thing I didn’t mention in my slides is that headers can be pointers into tables or etc. so they don’t actually have to be full objects in the MVP. So a hyper-specialized engine could optimize them to be simpler if it doesn’t want post-MVP features.

AR: That seems like exactly the sort of risk I’m talking about.

BT: But there are engines that won’t even support GC. There’s always the possibility that there’s some point in the space where some engine will stop implementing additional Wasm features.
JK: Engine will need some sort of RTTs to implement casts.

AR: I don’t see a way to optimize this without something like pointer compression.

JK: You need some identity for every struct on the heap. Semantically equivalent to a pointer to some type information.

AR: One thing I wondered in this discussion is if the name “RTT” is confusing things. It’s really just a “descriptor”. Type information is just one type of information you might want to store. Static information and GC information is also there.

BT: I don’t disagree with that classification. Still leaves the question of whether we need to make them first-class now, and I don’t think we do. I see it as a system of upgrades to the functionality we support. I think we can thread the needle here.

JK: I think that’s a great point. If in the future it turned out that explicit RTTs were more expensive than implicit ones, then this could be a tradeoff that languages could make…[interrupted]

AR: No, no. Explicit / run-time type objects came up in the early 2000s, coming out of experiences with the JVM and CIL that had not been designed with generics up front. The methods of adding them post-hoc ended up with undesirable semantics. As Thomas said, if these are values, then optimizers like Binaryen can immediately apply to the same things.

JK: I’m not making this up out of thin air. Previously, Andreas, you suggested that more than one RTT can refer to the same static type. As long as there is a single RTT for a static type, then you can do a single pointer comparison for a type check. Once there are multiple, it’s no longer a single comparison, some indirection is necessary.

AR: One thing that is a bit subtle here is that if you generalize RTTs to descriptors, then you can have multiple descriptors that describe the same type, but they all describe the same type. So if you do a Wasm-level cast then they are all identical. If you do different operations like the identity check Ben described, then they can behave differently. This also came up with the idea of the JS API using different RTTs that describe the same type.

BT: I’ve been repeatedly confused by RTTs over the years, but I was under the impression that RTTs would be an identity check. Going back to my slide, with the two types of casts, for the static case the RTT isn’t exactly a witness. The RTT is a holder of static type information.

JK: If there is more than one holder for each static type, then we actually have to read it rather than just do an identity check on it. But we have lots of exciting ideas and different preferences for what we should design. So we should leave all those conversations to have in the future.


AR: Agreed, but all of that depends on the RTT design we have today.

BT: polymorphic recursion mints new types.

AR: No, just instantiates type expressions that you need to compare. This is why piggybacking won’t work.

BT: I know we’ve argued about this and have different opinions, but piggybacking is the first thing language implementers try.

LW: I don’t think there’s a risk-free path forward. Incrementalism and non-incrementalism both have risks.

AK: I was curious if Luke or other folks have use cases for type imports in the near future, since AR brought up a concern that it would be delayed.

LW: For browser imports and for … (missed this).

AR: Can you say how they relate to the component stuff?

LW: We’re pretty happy with i32 indices into tables for now, but if the core Wasm uses GC, then type imports would be how you would type references flowing into that module. That’s not in the near future, though.
