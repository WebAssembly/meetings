### Discussion: Pushing RTTs to post-MVP (https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/275)

TL: Binaryen & V8 have been experimenting with versions of the instructions that don't take RTTs, and that works. Binaryen had been relying on lack of RTTs for optimization, but now that there's 1:1 relation between static types and RTTs that's no longer a factor.

TL: There seem to be two arguments for RTTs: JS API and generics. For the JS API, I'd suggest we think about that without RTTs being a hard requirement.

AR: I see one more reason, beyond generics & JS API (which I'd put last): having an explicit cost model for Wasm. With the MVP proposal, there was meant to be a 1:1 relationship between Wasm instructions and machine instructions; this was what was "low level" about Wasm. With GC we have to expand this to maintain safety [not 1:1 anymore]. Still important that producers be able to do optimizations without depending on sophisticated VM optimizations. It's all a bit fuzzy, but where we can, we should make costs explicit where it makes sense. RTTs try to do that: they represent operations that would be separate if producers were lowering to machine code instead of Wasm. With generics this becomes even more important. This was the original motivation for RTTs to exist. The JS API use case followed once RTTs existed.

BT: Cost argument is a sliding scale. If we applied it universally, e.g. call_indirect would be split into multiple operations. My reason for wanting to keep RTTs is that if they are implicit, that might be an extra load from the instance object. But that depends on implementation details, so the explicit cost argument cuts both ways.

AR: Fair, it is a blurry line. My argument is that, if it's something we'll need anyway, we should add it now since it also fits with the cost model. call_indirect is an interesting example, I don't think anyone was really happy with how that came out; if we had to do it again I could imagine it being designed differently.

BT: For this discussion, I feel that if we axe RTTs from the MVP, it might be one cut too much and we would end up shipping something unusable. As Luke and others have pointed out, we need generative RTTs for piggybacking source casts.

AR: I agree it can be useful for Java-style casts, though I don't see it as necessary: you could always do it yourself on top. But if we're going that way I think it's important to introduce nominal/abstract types, as in the type imports proposal, so that there's proper correspondence within the static type system. So the use-case of RTTs as a cast optimization for Java-style casts seems like not necessarily worth it alone.

TL: This is why I'd like us to defer RTTs: people seem to have lots of ideas of things that RTTs might be useful for, but without concrete users, different people will think they're for different things, leading to trouble

BT: We are in the game of building low-level building blocks that people are going to use in various ways. It's expected that people will build things that we don't even conceive of right now.

AR: My view is that anything we want long term is a superset of what RTTs provide, and that makes me confident that including them isn't a mistake.

TL: Do people think that RTTs provide value, right now, in the WasmGC MVP, not considering the JS API or generics?

CW: I think that's not the right bar.

AT: Is the idea that RTTS would be considered a follow-on proposal after the MVP? Or that they'd be added at, say Phase 3 of this proposal?

TL: I don't think we've met the bar for including them in the MVP right now. If we do see reasons to include them, then we could add them back before shipping the MVP

CW: Removing RTTs later seems like it should be simple, if indeed we find that they're not useful. I think the bigger risk is removing them too early.

TL: So if the spec were at a late stage, would you be OK with removing RTTs at that point?

CW: Yes

JK: There seems to be an exclusive or between what Ben is describing with generative RTTs and what Andreas has been describing with the 1:1 correspondence. We would have to do one or the other.

AR: The way you would marry the two is by introducing private types.

BT: It’s easier to do it with one instruction, rtt.fresh. In a previous implementation, I misunderstood that rtt.sub was not supposed to be generative and used a generative version to piggyback casts.

CW: FWIW, if that's the main use-case for RTTs, I'd be fine adding RTTs as a follow-on (along with rtt.fresh).

AZ: Don’t we lose optimizability with generative RTTs?

AR: That’s why we need the private types in the static type system as well.

BT: Would they be part of a recursion group, or…?

AR: They'd effectively be abstract types, treated nominally

BT: I see this operationally: how do we get the VM to generate the code we want? Adding lots of machinery, e.g. a type import, in order to generate 3 instructions seems like a lot of overhead.

AR: A private type is not necessarily an import. Want to maintain the property that you statically know what static type matches which RTT.

BT: Maybe we need both. Casts that respect the generative identity of RTTs and casts that don’t.

AR: Or we could have two different sorts of RTTs, transparent and intransparent.

BT: Probably don’t want to be a subtype so that the kind of cast is clear at each cast site.

AR: You’re right, the subtyping should go the other way.

TL: We do something similar in Binaryen & V8 right now: cast instructions that use RTTs, and others that are fully static. Regarding optimizability, modules that only use the static versions can have their casts optimized, while modules that use generative RTTs & casts don't get optimized.

MK (chat): There are no generative rtts anymore in v8. there used to be with the equirecursive types.

AR: If you can tell the static type of an RTT you can do that on a per-cast basis.

TL: If we maintain a 1:1 mapping between RTTs and static types, why even have the RTTs?

AR: That assumes you have the RTT. With generics, this would force you to reify type parameters everywhere, and this would be expensive for languages that didn't want to use casts much (or at all). 

BT: This is the place where the cost model that AR was talking about applies: if you have the RTT available, then you can use it.

LW: Until we have function level type parameters, we’re still forced to carry around RTTs on the instance level.

AR: Could stash the RTT in a local or something to keep it closer / in a register.

LW: But register allocator will do that anyway, so it’s not a meaningful difference.

CW: All these are post-MVP features

LW: For me it's the JS API & the question of what prototype to use. If we're okay with all WasmGC objects having the same prototype (either null, or something like Object.prototype), then RTTs wouldn't be needed for it.

AR: There’s both the prototype as well as named accessors. Accessors might need something else as well.

BT: If we did include generative RTTs now, are we confident that we could design a suitable JS API?

LW: I think I could see how it would work, but idk how confident everyone else is.

AT: On the JS API side there's a direction for that to work. On the JS side, there's a Structs proposal providing fixed-size objects, and Wasm objects could be represented by these on the JS side, based on info from the RTT.

BT: To check understanding, the idea is that the Wasm module would import the RTT with attached accessors, etc.?

AR: Yes, I replied to one of the threads with an example

BT: My fear is that if we remove RTTs tomorrow, we'll get to Phase 3 and then realize we can't implement the things that people need.

TL: To re-iterate, there are two clear capabilities that RTTs are needed for: generics & JS API. Generics are clearly post-MVP. I think we should be designing the JS API well before Phase 3; and while we're doing that we should keep our minds open that there might be solutions to JS API problems that don't involve RTTs.

CW: My hope is that we could remove them easily enough if we find they're not needed for anything in the MVP. But I can see the concern that having them "floating around" could change the JS API discussion.

LW: For the JS API, we could also imagine doing it in two stages, starting with null or a shared prototype, and later adding the capability of describing a prototype. 

CW: I expect that designing generics will take a while as well. Checking that the Wasm feature works for producers will take time.

AR: Generally agreed. When designing generics, I think we want to design something relatively simple, not the swiss-army-knife approach. Basically parametric polymorphism which allows code to operate generically on some set of types.

CW: That’s reasonable, and even reasonable to say we don’t expect generics to eliminate more than some small number of casts.

AR: Can still remove a ton of casts in some languages, but not all.

AT: I do like the idea of tabling this until a JS API is more clear. We need more examples of what producers would want from the JS API. Other languages not using WasmGC use some sort of proxy object API and it might be useful 

TL: I do think it's a useful exercise to think about what the most spartan API we could get away with in the MVP would be, that still fulfills user needs.

AK: Happy with tabling until we figure out the JS API, as I suggested on the thread. Strongly second Asumu’s call for more examples and requirements from users. Part of that is just where we are in the project. For example sheets has not integrated WasmGC into their product yet, so we don’t have feedback on the integration. Will soon, though.

CW: What do we need to do to get more producer feedback? Is Google already engaged with the right people or do we need to do more?

AK: We have the sheets team as well as the Dart team, which already has a JS API for their Web target.

SK: At Kotlin we are using V8’s experimental API and we will use more when there’s more to use.

AR: It’s a very niche consideration that is application/user specific. Not sure how to reason about it generally. Depends on how tight the coupling should be and there is a whole range of possibilities of what people want.

TL: If we don’t get a strong signal, we can ship something minimal and iterate on it post-MVP.

BT: Extra friction like having to implement another type system on top of Wasm pushes producers away and is a chilling effect. So we do need to consider producers needs rather than just shipping something we think is viable.

AR: I’ve mentioned before that having generative casts is not useful for languages beyond Java. Anything beyond that already requires implementing a type system on top of Wasm.

AR: What is the current state of JS in V8?

JK: It’s a completely opaque handle, like a reverse externref. Goal was to do the minimal thing for partners. We have a partial implementation of a solution using auto-generated names like field0, field1, etc. But it’s been on the back burner because there’s been no demand. Our partners have been solving other problems and we expect there to be more demand for good JS integration soon.

SK: The minimal requirements for the JS API probably come from the browser and DOM APIs, where we have to pass Wasm objects to those APIs.

AR: Why would you expect that to work?

SK: So we don’t need to create extra allocations?

AR: Do you have an example?

SK: e.g. WebIDL types. Dictionary, for example, would make sense.

CW: Could you write this up in more detail?

SK: Sounds good, will write an issue. Accessing fields will also be important.

TL: It will be great to have a write up of this.
