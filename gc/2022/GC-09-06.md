### Discussion: Cast operations (https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/274)

TL: Recap GitHub discussion so far. Three sub-discussions: Casting directly from any, factoring opcodes to be future, nullability. Manos, would rolling control of non-nullability into the casting instructions have any performance benefits in the code sequence emitted by the engine?

MK: Don’t think so, but would have to look deeper.

(No opposition to being able to cast directly from any)

(No opposition to having a single cast instruction targeting any abstract or user-defined type, even if it did not correspond 1:1 to a future cast instruction using RTTs.)

ZB (chat): Can internalized externref interfere with casting from anyref to any user's type?

TL: No, the most specific type of an internalized externref is `any`, so all downcasts would fail.

CW: We also might want a subtype of any specifically for internalized extern. But might be weird when roundtripping a Wasm value via a Wasm function that takes “internalized externref” as a parameter.

TL: If we had such a type, the roundtripping should probably trap on the implicit downcast.

CW: Agree, but thinking about this I realize it’s too weird and I am against adding such a type.

#### A concrete example motivating explicit RTTs

CW: Could have self-type quantifier on struct definitions so that method receivers could be specially marked as method receivers and “unwrapped” via a new cast-like operation that would use explicit RTTs to recover the specific type of the method receiver.

RH: Don’t quite understand the use of existential types for method receivers. Would be good to have a concrete write-up in Wasm terms.

CW: Can see if Andreas is interested in writing that up.

### Progress toward phase 3

FM: How far away are we from phase 3?

TL: We’ve made good progress since phase 2. About four large issues left to settle (casting, JS API, making array.new_data and array.new_elem constant, and possibly pushing i31 to post-MVP). If we keep up our velocity, maybe we can be ready for phase 3 around November?
