### Discussion: meeting cadence

TL: Not now, but soon will have few enough issues that we can change the meeting cadence to once monthly.

(No objections)

### Discussion: call_indirect subtyping and final types ([#329](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/329))

MK: Investigated how much binary code size increases after having MVP Wasm modules check subtypes in call_indirect. Checked two real-world benchmarks. 7.5% and 10.2% code size increase in optimized tier. Our implementation has bloated code, so other implementations could be smaller, but would be surprised if it went below a few percent.

AR: Do you have a sense of the average case?

MK: I can run experiments. The experiment showing the minimal increase wasn’t a real world benchmark.

AR: Any performance measurements?

MK: Not yet.

AR: Could be code caching implications, but otherwise we would hope that the fast path is still fast.

RH: I’ve been hoping to provide another data point from SM. The problem is that our downcasting code is absolutely terrible right now. I’ve been working on optimizing that. Hope to have results some time this week.

CW: For determining [runtime] impact, it would be fine for downcasts to be gross and out of line, right?

RH: My hope is that we can have the same downcasting logic for structs, arrays, and functions. The way I’m trying to implement it is so we can have a simple inline path for everything. I think that’s feasible. If so, adding it to call_indirect should have minimal code size impact. I don’t think an out of line fallback path should be necessary at this time.

CW: Was just thinking for initial numbers for MVP Wasm.

RH: Could do something hacky to get numbers sooner.

TL: Not urgent.

RH: Question of what to do if we have disparate impact. Final types would be ok, but would be nice to avoid them.

ASC: I would be interested in seeing measurement of how final types would affect other casts besides in call_indirect. Final types could have the same code size, icache, and compilation speed benefits everywhere.

AR: You mean where you cast from an abstract type to a final concrete type?

ASC: Yes, or from concrete to concrete.

AR: I think a final type with a supertype doesn’t buy you anything.

ASC: If you cast to a final type, then it can just be an address comparison. There are lots of that kind of casts.

BT: It’s worth noting that that will change if we have casts for custom metaobjects in the future, that optimization won’t work anymore.

AR: Would require an extra indirection.

ASC: If we could decide on an encoding for final types to do the experiment, we could start using them in dart2wasm and get WasmGC test data at least.

AR: In terms of the design, it would make sense to add a sub_final rather than duplicating func, array, and struct.

TL: Andreas, can you propose an encoding offline?

AR: Sure, will be tomorrow.

TL: Manos, any path to reducing call_indirect code bloat in the near future?

MK: No, would require extensive refactoring.

JK: Current implementation optimized for speed, not size.

### Discussion: types outside rec groups ([#334](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/334))

TL: Any objections to keeping the current semantics of non-rec types being the same as having singleton rec groups?

CW: What would be the method for making this work with type parameters in the future?

AR: Would require different kinds of type parameters.

TL: No further comments. Resolved to keep the current semantics.

### Discussion: issue triaging

TL: (Sharing screen to show GitHub issue labels)

TL: Mapping Java null-ptointer exceptions is a clear candidate for post-MVP

AR: Doesn’t our redesign of casts solve this?

TL: Language implementers want instructions that throw exceptions directly on nulls.

ZB (chat): It would be nice to have this.

FM: Could use GitHub discussions for some of these usage notes issues.

TL: Good idea.
