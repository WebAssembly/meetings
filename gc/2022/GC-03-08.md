### Discussion: No-frills JS API and moving a richer API to post-MVP ([#279](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/279)) 

TL: Partners have told me that custom accessors or prototypes for structs aren’t necessary for the MVP, but they’re concerned about the performance of arrays and avoiding unnecessary overhead when using e.g. regex methods that return arrays of strings that need to be moved into Wasm.

AR: What is specific about arrays…?

TL: …

BT: Are there open issues about arrays?

TL: Not yet, most existing discussion has focused on structs.

CW: How much would duck typing to make GC arrays array-like in JS work?

TL: Unclear, but it might be sufficient. We haven’t been able to get implementer feedback on this yet.

LW: This seems solvable without custom prototypes. Array-like methods.

BT: Typed arrays?

JK: Personal opinion is that there will be no exposable arraybuffer underneath. Pretending they do would require a copy and negate any benefits of that approach.

AR: Besides basics, any requests?

KM: …

BT: Backing store of exposable arrays would have to be off heap

KM: Passing these arrays to audio, blink, etc. is probably going to be a common use case.

JK: That would be the biggest implementation challenge: exposing WasmGC arrays as TypedArrays on the JS/web API side is going to be much harder than just exposing duck-typed arrays.

KM: That could be one advantage of making a WasmGC array of u8 an alias of the JS u8 typed array. Kind of gross for implementation, but good for interop.

JK: There are also disadvantages, e.g. allocating TypedArrays is more expensive than allocating Wasm GC arrays in V8.

KM: I see. That’s not the case in JSC.

LW: Spidermonkey stored a few elements inline in the header to make the small cases fast.

BT: Is it still the case in JSC that TypedArrays are gigacaged?

KM: Yes

AR: Luke, are you suggesting having diverse representations of arrays in Wasm?

LW: You would store a pointer to the actual array

AR: That would also be another indirection.

LW: Yeah, not advocating this. Detachability is another tricky point.

KM: Why is allocating TypedArrays slower in V8?

JK: Not sure, and not sure what the current state is regarding small backing stores (whether those are stored on the GC heap or not). But don't have enough knowledge off the top of my head.

BT: As I left it when I left, there’s a C++ managed pointer that needs to be allocated for all backing stores and that requires popping out to C++, which is slow.

AR: I wouldn't just worry about the cost of allocation, also the size of the thing would be bigger than arrays, which doesn't align with the goals of the proposal.

KM: Not sure in JSC whether it’s any bigger.

CW: Somewhat of a rabbit hole, partners may end up being happy with basic array-like accesses.

KM: Could special case some special kind of array for the audio use case maybe.

BT: Another alternative would be to make TypedArrays allocated in JS reflected as a Wasm array; this might be easier.

CW: That might mean calling out to JS to create arrays to get that kind of special array.

BT: Yes, but only for the ones you get from JS.

KM: The risk is you don't know how your arrays travel through code.

CW: That suggests a constrained version of the kind of custom section we were discussing before, where you'd say "this is the kind of array that needs to be more complicated"

AR: Want to note that if you can customize RTTs then you can reuse them for this as well.

CW: Like that, but specifically for arrays

LW: Regarding representation, if we don't statically know the size of arrays doesn't that mean we'd always need to have an indirection?

BT: Probably we’re slicing this too finely because it’s just a couple machine instructions, so it needs to be measured.

LW: If there was always this indirection to the array contents, possibly cheap, then doing the original array-as-arraybuffer becomes feasible again.

AR: My understanding is that the reason you want to store them out-of-line is because you want to be able to pass just the backing store to some web API. For Wasm arrays, why would you not want to store the elements inline?

BT: The key thing is that you need to make it non-moving.

AR: So you would have some section of your heap where objects don’t move.

CW: What’s the Wasm type for byte arrays? Do we support arrays of i8? (Yes)

JK: With the GC proposal, yes you can.

CW: My impression was that there exist JS functions that process arrays of strings.

JK: The background there is that apps want to process strings, e.g. splitting via regexes. Without a JITting regex engine in Wasm, calling out to JS might make sense, but then you have to do the splitting on the JS side. One array is a primitive array of character data. The other is a JS array of JS strings. How can we make it possible to make a JS array, then extract elements on the Wasm side? Could export a WasmGC array constructor.

AR: I'd assume the JS API would provide ways to construct [Wasm] arrays and structs on the JS side. So the way to handle this would be to pass an optional constructor to operations that output arrays so you could pass in the Wasm versions.

JK: This touches on the strategic question of how we want to go about JS API design. No-frills approach would only use exports for this. Other approaches might have a richer JS API, but that’s a deep rabbit hole.

AR: I was assuming that the no-frills approach would include a constructor on the JS side. It's not clear you'd want to throw that out.

CW: The constructor is only part of the story. The other story is to change the regex functions to know to use that constructor.

AR: Yes it would be an extension to the JS regex API, but I don't know what else you could do.

JK: Theoretically we could specify automatic conversion of JS array to array of externref.

AR: That's probably even more expensive, depending on how big it is. But sure, that's the other approach.

CW: Didn’t this already come up as something the JS side wasn’t thrilled about doing? Arraybuffer interop - didn’t want to change all functions to choose what kind of array to write to.

AR: I could definitely see that being reacted negatively too.

AK: Thinking about @@species. There’s a lot of push back against that in TC39 these days.

JK: We also don’t want to use it - probably wouldn’t help.

AK: Changing JS APIs is a much bigger rabbit hole than just JS interop.

CW: For regex with strings, if what you get back as an array of externref, then that's another wart.

AR: It seems the real answer can only be interface types and small ad hoc solutions will not get us there.

CW: Interface types bites the bullet, though, and says there's always going to be a copy, and a deep copy at that. Not clear that meets the use-cases.

LW: I think there could be smaller intermediate solutions that aren’t shared-nothing. For example WebAssembly.Function for converting JS to Wasm functions. Could extend that with additional things, like having a flag for using a receiver. Could have another option for coercing result to GC array. Then could add an optimization to the built in to construct the GC array eagerly.

AR: Don't you quickly wind up needing the same type algebra to compose these cases?

LW: Scoping down goals to just high-value use cases, should be tractable. GC types are way simpler than linear memory types, too.

AR: It goes both ways, you might need a way to convert a Wasm thing into some JS thing.

LW: If you know you're calling into something that takes a JS value, then you let ToJSValue take care of the high value cases. It wouldn't be a complete fix but it might be sufficient.

FM: To add one point to the interface types discussions. People assume there will always be a copy, but it’s always been true that we could optimize to not copy for e.g. immutable arrays and strings.

LW: Indeed, and likewise for strings which are immutable.

CW: Has Andy Wingo’s strings proposal been presented to the CG yet? (No)

TL: This has been a great discussion of arrays, which we haven't yet had on Github. Clear next step would be to create an issue on GH. Popping back up, apart from what we do with arrays, regarding custom struct accessors, is anyone not happy with moving custom struct accessors to post-MVP?

BT: In lieu of that, what would we have?

TL: For structs you could export getters & setters and use those to access structs from the outside. For arrays I don't want to commit to anything today, maybe it would just be accessors or maybe something richer.

JK: For structs, an advantage of accessors vs index-based access gives tools the opportunity to know which fields are used externally. Allows optimizations like field reordering. Whereas if there's index-based field access (like struct.get) then all bets are off.

AR: Wouldn't it need to know what the accessors do?

JK: Yes, but the tools can see that, since it can see all code in the module.

TL: Example, Binaryen optimizes out fields that are never read?

AR: How often does that happen?

TL: Happens a lot in practice with the Java code we've been looking at. This is also how dead code elimination on vtables works.

AR: But this would preclude no-frills approaches for the entire future?

JK: As long as we provide some way to limit access to fields in that future API.

AR: Seems like overkill.

CW: This could also be left to the toolchain to figure out how much of this information it wants to carry around.

BT: Bikeshedding, the right way to access which fields are read is to export a type. Assumes that you'll be able to reflect on exported types, and not reflect types that are not exported.

AR: Reflection allows even more uses.

TL: This is definitely something we could solve on the toolchain side with a manifest that describes what gets accessed. Emscripten does something similar with Meta DCE, which allows dead code elimination across the Wasm/JS boundary. But of course that's way more complicated than just looking at the Wasm module. The point, though, is that only exposing accessors for now will be simpler for tools today to deal with. If we add fancier stuff in the future, we can also do fancier work in tools to keep those optimizations working.

TL: Not hearing any objections to moving custom struct access to post-MVP, propose creating a new phase 0 repo for this and add an agenda item for the full CG to announce this split. I will take care of these.

TL: Naming? "GC JS API" is too broad…will post an issue and we can bikeshed there.

AR: "GC JS customization?"

TL: Sounds fine, we can always change it later.

ZB [in chat]: "Wasm GC JS interop"

FM: Listening to the conversation, the first thing we're going to need is requirements. I heard a lot of different ideas today, we need to be clear on what the actual requirements are in order to make anything useful.

JK: Absolutely. That’s the biggest reason to do no-frills now and expand later. We need to figure out what problems we want to solve.

ASC: One thing I was thinking about for the interop is how GC objects behave more generally on the JS side. Can you compare them by reference? Can you put them in weak maps and finalization registries?

[general nodding agreement]

TL: Absolutely

AR: Putting them in Maps will require hash values in many implementations, a little nasty.

JK: In V8, we already have that hash value field because we expected that use case.

BT: Isn’t that inescapable because any JS value can go into a map?
AR: JS is already irregular, so throwing in that case wouldn’t be too out there.

CW: For WeakMaps specifically, if we go to a world where we have shared Wasm objects, those should not be allowed as keys because then you could keep things alive across threads.
In that case could trap if you try to use a shared object as a key but not a shared one.

AK: Though JS is irregular in many ways, one of the benefits of WasmGC is to be able to interact with the host side in ways that interact with the GC, so it would be a shame not to support finalization registry.

AR: That is fine as long as it does not make WasmGC fundamentally more expensive.

JK: I’m not concerned about the cost of storing a hash value. Could even expose it in a new future instruction since many languages need their own hash value.

BT: I don't want to expose the hash, that's a mistake the JVM made

AR: In typical functional languages, a tuple that's a pair is 3 words, I'd hate to make this much more expensive.

SK (chat): non-determenism of hash codes is a bit scary, but duplicating hashes is would be silly indeed

JK (chat): Slava: the hash is not directly exposed to JS, it's engine-internal. For now, you'll have to duplicate it if you need it.

BT: I generally agree with Andreas. Lost battle in Java, but generally want a 1-word header in Wasm.

TL: Thanks, ASC, indeed as part of the MVP we'll need to specify even in the no-frills approach how these things look from JS. Hopefully we can pull in a JS expert to help with this.

SK (chat): Maybe JS function to get a hash code then? Importing it would avoid changes to core wasm

TL: I'll put this on the agenda for the next CG meeting.
