###  Discussion: func <:? any [#293](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/293) (30 minutes)


JK: We use different representations for functions in JS and Wasm to make function calls more efficient in each domain. That means we need to convert the representation on the boundary. Passing an anyref on the boundary, we have to inspect it to see if it’s a function. It would be nice to avoid this performance wart. We decided to drop the subtyping when we standardized funcrefs because there was no use case for it and we still haven’t seen any use cases, so I don’t think we should change it.

AR: To clarify, the decision was to defer it rather than drop it entirely. (Ed note: this note taker disagrees). There is some small extra complication with multiple nulls, in validation, etc.

TL: Since our subtyping is supposed to be subsumptive, it seems like a better representation of the engine to keep them separate.

BT, AR: But it’s only on the boundary.

JK: There is implementation freedom. Can move check to call site rather than boundary.

BT: Could also split externref back out from anyref and use that for passing opaque host references.

JK, AR: That’s already settled.

AR: Isn’t there already something similar happening?

JK: Proving that hostrefs cannot be casted to i31 requires doing extra work as well.

AR: Would want to make that deterministic so that all numbers in range can be downcast to i31.

JK: Do we? Since anyref is open, it can always be an opaque value.

CW: Doesn’t seem like a good idea to have different behavior depending on how engine represents a number.

JK: Doesn’t seem reasonable to be able to expect to be able to inspect an anyref you don’t control.

CW: But you might control it because you generate both the JS and Wasm.

BT: We’re talking about all values in JS. Suppose we chose not to check the i31 range…

RH: I would like to understand the cost of _not_ having the subtype relationship. Would we never be able to add a new type that is a subtype of any? Like closureref for func.bind?

AR: I’m pretty confident that we could add this subtype relationship later, and of course we always need to be able to add new types that are subtypes of any. So closureref would not be a problem.

CW: Would the dead code typing relaxation proposal help?

AR: There’s still something you have to do… Also without top anyref, you have to formulate rules to work on multiple hierarchies.

BT: Would like to know what the cost is on wasmtime, since internally in Wasm there is no cost in V8.

GK: Don’t know, but letting fastly people know that you are wondering.

BT: Would like to know a specific performance number.

AR: Agree. Think we could go either way, keeping types separate now and adding the subtyping later or having the subtyping now and adding a rawfunc type later.

BT: The other consideration is whether we have a use case for the subtyping now. I commented a few weeks ago that it could be useful for universal representations.

TL: What languages would it be useful in?

BT: Virgil, but I don’t expect anyone else to be able to comment. Doesn’t use them yet.

AR: Speculating that we could use them for method pointers.

BT: Would prefer to keep the simpler path now and justify the complexity with performance data in the future. (simpler path is to keep subtyping).

ASC: Anything that adds costs to round tripping will be bad for Dart.

TL: Can we experiment?

ASC: Yes, can make a Dart benchmark and experiment in V8.

AR: Sympathetic, but concerned that we have to pay these costs anyway for i31. What does V8 do with i31 right now.

JK: Not sure, might just disallow it for now. Our goal is to pass anyref as just a pointer with no checks. Could have an uninspectable anyref above inspectable anyref in the type hierarchy.

BT: Isn’t that just an externref type?

AR: If the point of anyref is to be generic over Wasm and host types, then you need to be able to downcast it to the Wasm types.

JK: Externref is currently opaque but can be passed around. This is what we would preserve with an uninspectable top type.

AR: Wouldn’t be virtualizable. You wouldn’t be able to implement an opaque DOM node in Wasm.

JK: I see. Will have to think about that.

TL: Let’s get those performance numbers and revisit this discussion. Sounds like both paths are viable.

CW: Let’s consider i31 as well, since it seems to have similar issues.

BT: … Cast gets more expensive in Wasm.

ASC: Casts from anyref being more expensive is fine as long as casts from eqref do not get more expensive.

AR: I think I also suggested moving cost to cast. The JS call might need to deal with raw Wasm values. Could also only normalize one direction and not the other. But sounds like ASC doesn’t want cost in either direction, which would mean more work in JS.

### Discussion: type system modes from changing subtyping [#296](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/296) (Ben Titzer, 30 minutes)

BT: We changed externref to be an alias for anyref. When I updated Wizard, I needed to add a flag for this so it would pass both new and old tests.

CW: To be clear, this is about old tests that tested validation failure?

BT: Yes.

CW: We are going to get ourselves in trouble if we want to do anything here. Any engine has to pay the engineering cost if it wants to support old tests like that.

BT: Agree that the general case needs flags. But subtyping is special. Might assume that new subtypes won’t be added.

TL: Do you think it’s a viable solution to just document in the spec that such assumptions won’t hold?

BT: no.

CW: It requires a contrived change to break things this way.

BT: I agree that if we’re careful, we can make sure that any subtype relation we add in the future is safe now that we know it’s a problem. Worried about which module gets blamed when things go weird between multiple modules produced at different Wasm versions.

AR: The type system would have had to have had some negative information, such as types being documented as closed. I agree we could accidentally add cases that break this, but I think it will be easy to avoid. Especially with anyref, which is open.

CW: Not too concerned about open and closed because we can’t prevent toolchains from treating any as closed and creating a web compat hazard, even if we document it as open.

JK: Can introduce a new type whenever we would otherwise want to add a new subtyping.

CW: That would be safe, but I think it’s stronger than necessary.

BT: Also always safe to add new types on top.

CW: Dangerous part is adding intermediate types.

AR: Don’t think you can break anything by introducing subtyping where you couldn’t observe it before.

CW: Example: supertype of both anyref and funcref, then try to make funcref <: anyref. This is silly, but would definitely break things.

BT: The module that can’t observe subtypes doesn’t go wrong, but an intermediary module, for example a security layer filtering out funrefs wouldn’t be able to filter funcrefs on the version of the language without the subtyping, but then if we add the subtyping and the filter doesn’t get updated, funcrefs could get through.

CW: But this is similar to accidental ABI breaks. Can’t guard against this kind of mistake in general.

BT: But it’s about who gets blamed when things go wrong, and in this case it’s WebAssembly that changes, so WebAssembly will get blamed.

AR: Still don’t think this kind of contract is expressible in Wasm. You can test for the things you know and reject everything else, and that will continue to work.

TL: What is the action item? Is it sufficient to document that this is a hazard and handle it on a case by case basis?

BT: Documentation is good, would also want to bias toward adding subtyping early to avoid hazards. Would also want to bring back externref and place it under anyref.

AR: Might also want to add new subtypes of data in the future. Might have same problem because older modules might get something they don’t expect. So it’s not just anyref that is special here.

JK: The argument I find compelling against bringing back externref is the same virualizability of DOM nodes from before.

AR: Would be happy to have both, but don’t see that they’re practically useful.

BT: Let’s look at all the possible trees we can create from our current types and crank through the implications. Will take an action item to start this.
