### Discussion: built in type hierarchy ([#307](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/307))

[Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/17kCocIk1uW_W3cW-Nx_sJm1ENirGJD6MuMnqzOYs9OY/edit?usp=sharing)

TL: Describing benefits and issues of top types.

AR: Polymorphism issue is same as module interface choice problem.

BT: Experiment: Should func be separate from any?

TL: Could we do this in Wizard?

BT: Probably not fast enough.

CW: Might make sense to prototype with func <: intern so that at least every reftype that can be created in a Wasm module is under one type.

AR: Lazy conversions are fastest in "polymorphic" use case, but have other overheads. No design for externref is strictly better than the others. Want to be careful not to be naive with measurements.

ASC: Boundary representation conversions are not limited to reftypes. Could introduce a new lazy value feature for all types, which would have nothing to do with the type hierarchy.

BT: Are you proposing that extern be a completely separate type that is not related to references?

ASC: Right.

AR: This makes several assumptions about the host, for example that all the types can share a representation.

BT: One problem is that the encoding of externref is ref extern, so if we wanted to do something like that, it would have to be a new type.

CW: Also, if we do that, we would still want extern ref as a subtype of extern to distinguish reference types.

ASC: Good point AR that not all hosts could use the uniform representation.

FM: For JS promise integration we have these opaque suspender objects that we don’t want to be part of any hierarchy. It’s not a JS value but it is a reference. Would be good to pass it as an externref.

BT: Question for Aske: Would type imports with optional subtype constraint fulfil the use case for lazy value?

AR: Two kinds of type imports. Either you have an eager compilation scheme like we have now where you require a uniform representation for the types that can be supplied, or you have a model with type specialization where you compile after the imports are supplied. I believe we want to support both eventually, but the current model can’t support the latter. But I think that’s a whole different discussion.

BT: It’s a long discussion, but we have to make choices for the MVP. I propose to limit the host values to references for now.

CW: +1

TL: Any points of discussion on concrete hierarchy in Jamboard?

CW: Would there only be conversions between extern and intern, or also to other types?

TL: Would want conversions directly to func, i31, etc. to save work.

AR: I would prefer to keep it simple and well-factorized by only converting to intern.

CW: Maybe we could keep it factorized like that and define the semantics in terms of conversion then downcast.

MK: Could also have the engine recognize those patterns and fuse them in codegen.

AR: I would prefer not to have cast or conversion instructions directly from extern or intern to user-defined e.g. struct types since examining which user type something is is a very different operation. Also RTTs will change the signature of casts to user types in the future.

BT: Need to figure out whether we want a top type.

TL: Intern needs to be able to hold all extern even if they are not eq or func?

AR: Yes, otherwise it would be impossible to be polymorphic over both internal and external references.

MK: Think it’s ok if there’s no bijection.

AR: The bijection can have a representation change.

BT, MK: Thought that intern was meant to exclude extern?

CW: I previously thought that, but it seems harmless to let it be any instead, and that would allow the polymorphism Andreas was talking about.

TL: Could we add a top type post-MVP?

CW: This would give you the same expressivity and costs as using extern on the boundary and converting eagerly.

AR: Again, there are situations where lazy conversions would be better.

BT: Would like an engine to not require a new header word to distinguish between extern and intern.

AR: Don’t think that an engine needs to do anything since the types can’t be compared.
