### Discussion: Cast operations (https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/274)

TL: Recap of discussion. Want constraint that we can cast directly from `any`.

AR: Tried to come up with design where the two instructions end up with the same codegen.

MK: Can’t have same map for all data types because arrays are different.

AR: The problem is that we have introduced the array type, then.

ASC: Not the type as such, but rather that the implementation of `is_data` is “is_struct or is_array”.

BT: There’s a tag check for i31 as well that will be in every cast.

ASC: Right, if the input can be i31 then it has to check that tag as well.

MK: But that will happen whether we cast from any to a specific type or not.

AR: First step would check that we have a data, second step wouldn’t have to check i31.

BT: Also depends on how we treat null.

ASC: is_data is too specific… (note taker missed this)

AR: Fast path where you ignore subtyping and check equality, and only if it fails you go on a slow path?

ASC: Yes, and Manos did some experiments that showed that having the fast path was faster unless it’s completely unpredictable.

AR: I can believe that. In most cases the hierarchy is probably shallow, just one or two deep. Do you know what the numbers were for that optimization?

ASC: Think it was about 10% faster with the fast path, still with as_data there, so difference will be bigger without that. Then the fast path can save a cache miss (looking up the RTT) as well.

AR: This only happens when casting down from any or eq. How often does that come up?

ASC: It doesn’t occur very much in dart2wasm at the moment, but could become very common if we start to use the current i31 spec that would force the LUB to be higher up.

AR: In my experience, you usually have larger unions so you check i31 first and never need to check it again.

ASC: Yeah, except we don’t have the ability to express that in the type system. We don’t have a type for “not i31”.

AR: Wouldn’t data take that role?

ASC: But if you have to test for data first, then you’ve wasted that time as previously discussed.

BT: Trying to express Andreas’s concern to see if I understand it. Is it a problem that the code you get from a single cast instruction is different depending on what you’re casting to?

AR: Yeah, that’s one problem. It’s very heterogeneous, especially since we’ve hidden away the runtime types.

BT: I definitely see an argument for a new instruction using RTTs in the future. But I’ve been thinking about the issue of having heterogeneous casts and I think it’s ok. Casts are already weird and engines might have different implementation strategies. Whether they’re heterogeneous depends on the implementation.

AR: I can see that to some degree. There’s some difference along these lines that will materialize in any implementation. All engines are going to have more complicated object descriptions for some types. Also want to point out that the Wasm type information is not what you need at runtime except for casts. For example eqness and mutability are important for soundness but not codegen. You could imagine that the internal layout information is much simpler than the Wasm type system. I want to be able to eliminate the more complex information where possible.

TL: But the instruction factorization is just a hint for that. Engine implementors can still do whatever they want.

BT: Whole program analysis…

AR: Within a toolchain, will have conventions about which types have additional information. With generics, can compile entirely without casts and remove a lot of runtime information. There should be options to have representations without overhead. Want pay-as-you-go.

BT: Once you have the ability to have code you don’t know about, the engine doesn’t know what runtime information is unnecessary because of cross-module type canonicalization. Even if the current module doesn’t have an rtt.canon, some other module might have one on the same types.

AR: I don’t follow. Linking and canonicalization is about static types. But I’m talking about not requiring embedding this information in the allocated heap objects.

BT: But that’s not the design we currently have. Another module can cast a value you pass to it.

AR: But we are assuming that other module is from the language runtime, so it would be an invariant of that language runtime that the objects have RTTs.

TL: If language supports casts at all, will have RTTs no matter whether a particular module contains casts. Only elide RTTs if the language doesn’t support the cast at all.

AR: Yes, but of course it’s more nuanced. Different types support different casts, etc. In OCaml something like 99% of allocations are less than 4 words, so saving this space is extremely important.

BT: I think we’re shooting for maximum one header word on objects. There are definitely languages that don’t even need that, but you only know that if you have the whole program.

TL: Andreas is assuming we add a new allocation instruction that does not tie an RTT to the allocation.

LW: But you actually need to statically separate those types if you want to remove the header word entirely because that affects field layout.

AR: That’s true. I hadn’t been shooting that high. I am imagining new allocation instructions where you specify an RTT that might be a supertype. If you specify `any`, then you can’t cast to anything. Trying to keep the door open for a design like this.

BT: We can’t keep the door open for significantly different designs. Need to design based on current language needs.

TL: Popping back to concrete question of what MVP casts should look like, has the background discussion changed any opinions? Andreas, what do you think about casting from any given the discussion on performance?

AR: Least ugly thing would be to have one instruction for `any` to concrete type and a separate instruction for `any` to abstract types.

BT: Another dimension is what to do with null.

AR: Could add an immediate to the instructions saying whether they mean to include null.

BT: If we made the cast target a value type, it could encode the nullability. This could also generalize to other new complications we add on top of nullability in the future.

AR: I think most of the possible extensions will go into the type section rather than in the value type encoding.

BT: General problem that we’ve been baking choices of type constructors into instructions. Will be difficult to add more dimensions in the future. For example const and mutable references.

ASC: Or i31 as a type dimension.

AR: Not comfortable using value types when we don’t know what that will mean in the future.

TL: Could always add new cast instructions when we add those new complications.

BT: Just trying to find the most future-compatible option. We have some warts in the binary encoding

TL: Do we even need to parameterize all the instructions? When I looked before, it seemed that only ref.cast needed it.

AR: Think that’s right. Branches can be decomposed into multiple branches, so maybe only ref.cast and ref.test need it.

ASC: Needs extra blocks in some cases if it’s not combined. You want a branch on “this type or null” and on “this type and not null”

TL: Few minutes left, seems like there are more details to discuss. Let’s lock in the high-level design of having one set of instructions casting from `any` to concrete types and another set casting from `any` to abstract types, and let’s try to figure out the remaining details on the GitHub issue before the next meeting.
