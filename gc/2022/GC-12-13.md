### Logistical note

TL: This will be the last meeting of the year. We will resume on January 10, 2023.

### Discussion: Types on the JS-Wasm boundary ([#279](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/279))

TL: (recap of the discussion so far, potential future problem that implicit casts won’t scale to explicit RTTs)

AR: Concerned that this sets expectations that would lead to dead ends.

TL: Is there a solution you would prefer?

AR: Would prefer the conservative approach of just using the top types.

RH: Was there discussion of how a Wasm function would be invoked from JS with explicit RTTs, or was it always expected that the cast would have to be explicit in Wasm?

AR: Good question. Expect to be able to create RTTs from JS. Can do explicit cast on either side.

RH: Could use WebAssembly.Function to create wrapper that knows which RTT to use.

TL: Sounds like there is some design space to figure out something nice here in the future.

TL: Worried that top types only do not have enough ergonomic benefits over just externref. For wasm-split, for example, we would want arbitrary types to avoid having to change the cross-module ABI.

TL: We will also want arbitrary types to cross into JS eventually, it’s just a matter of time. Would be good to solve now instead of waiting for someone to need it.  (FM agrees)

AR: Concerned that the solution doesn’t scale.

TL: It scales for producers who don’t want generics / type imports, etc. and don’t need explicit RTTs.

RH: Using canonical RTT is no worse than it not working at all in those situations.

AR: Fair point. You can always have the casts, but it might be more expensive.

RH: There will always have to be a cast. Question of what you are casting to. Canonical RTT is the only option now, but in the future that might not be what folks want. But we don’t plan to extend toWebAssemblyValue.

FM: From a naive point of view, it seems like a no-brainer to allow arbitrary types. But I accept that folks don’t need it now.

AR: What does this mean for function types? Needs higher order casts.

RH: Can you elaborate?

AR: Does this involve only Wasm casts or also JS values?

TL: Only Wasm values that have flowed out and are flowing back in, at least for structs and arrays.

JK: For functions, needs to be a Wasm function or the result of a WebAssembly.Function so it has a type. It sounds pretty wild to me to automatically invoke WebAssembly.Function. Let’s not do that now.

AR: Agree. Given that, since all functions have declared subtypes, I guess it makes sense.

AT: For the implicit casts in the anyref hierarchy, it’s also an extern.internalize before the downcast, right?

TL: Yes.

JM: If I send a Wasm value to JS, and in the future I might be able to add properties to it or something, then pass it back in to Wasm, should I expect that extra information to be preserved?

JK: Safe to assume you will never be able to change the shape of Wasm values.

RH: What about exported functions, which you can add things to?

JM: In that case it causes the Wasm function to transition to a different representation. We want to avoid having representation checks everywhere.

AR: Not sure I understand. How does the GC proposal change anything about this?

JM: If all you can do is call a function, it’s fine. But if we have to figure out what RTT is canonical for that function, we’ll have to store extra info in the structure. If they never change shape, that’s fine. But if they do change shape, we’d have to do extra bookkeeping. We don’t want Wasm values to ever change shape in Wasm.

AR: I don’t think we should ever allow changing the shape that’s visible to Wasm.

RH: Sounds like you’re using the shape both for properties and casting. Using the same thing for both gets weird.

AR: Right, I’ve said before that using e.g. V8 Maps as the RTT is not scalable. You’d need a separate RTT.

JM: It would be bad to pessimize everyone passing things across the boundary to support adding properties to WebAssembly exported functions.

AR: Probably too late to specify exported functions objects as frozen. Do we know?

JM: Keeping the hidden Wasm type sounds reasonable, but concerned about losing perf here in the future.

AR: Why didn’t we make them frozen? Was that an oversight?

AT: They are not specified as frozen right now.

AR: Would it be worth experimenting with fixing this?

JM: That would be good.

RH: I also want to mention that SM is in a similar situation where we’ve been trying to use the same representation in Wasm and JS. Ran into this implementing function downcasts. I was soft planning not to reuse the shape for the type info but rather to store it in a slot. That makes them different from structs, but that’s ok because they have a different representation.

AR: I was assuming something like that as well. Can save space by hanging it off the shape, but then there’s another indirection.

TL: If Ryan was planning to do this anyway, is this a hit we already have to take for unrelated reasons?

JM: Don’t think so. Want flexibility.

TL: Would not want to vote on this until known potential blockers are investigated and resolved.

AR: Can’t change the type as long as WebAssembly still holds a reference, though.

JM: Oh no.

JK: We also used to do this, but we ended up splitting our representation into a pair of objects that refer to each other, one Wasm and one JS, and on the boundary it just flips which one is visible.

JM: Sounds interesting.

TL: Should we resolve this now or do folks want more time to investigate and report back on the issue?

RH: Would be fine resolving for now.

JM: Would also be fine resolving for now.

Unanimous consent: Allow arbitrary GC types on boundary and have an implicit downcast in toWebAssemblyValue.

### Discussion: Final types and call_indirect subtyping ([#329](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/329), [#339](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/pull/339))

TL: Any objections to implementing final types as proposed and allowing downcasting on call_indirect?

RH: Did anyone implement it?

TL: V8 implemented and did experiments with Dart that showed benefits.

MK: Can confirm that.

RH: No objections.

(Unanimous consent)
