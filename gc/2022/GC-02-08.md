### Discussion: Changing to using PRs for agendas

AB: Thumbs up in chat.

No objections.

TL: Ok, going forward we will organize our agendas via PRs to the meetings repo.

### Discussion: Schedule for going to phase 2

CW: Numbers?

TL: Posted on issue. Small overhead over nominal types, but definitely linear. Only measured with single rec group, no worries from our side about overhead.

CW: Experimenting with linking?

ASC: Dart still wants to do this, but it’s going to be further out.

TL: Any reason to discuss this again at next meeting or should we take it to the CG next week?

AR: No reason to wait

ZB: No reason to wait

FM: no reason to wait.

TL: Will put together a presentation for next week with overview of our status and a vote for phase 2.

AR: Will aim to land the PR ahead of the meeting.


### Discussion: i31 as a type dimension

BT: [presenting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fwDLjfaqpLZuuics1m8I--K-Zhpz1BLQnsrR8T-vIwA/edit#slide=id.p)

AR: Extra checks needed only if you're using `eq` or `any`; if you're not using `i31`, you could use `data` everywhere and avoid the overhead.

BT: Yes, that's the cost of `i31` being part of the heap type hierarchy [continues presenting slides]

CW: I see this as necessary because we don't have a general union facility, so you have to use `eq` or `any` as a union.

BT: Right, which is why the issue proposes adding union types for i31.

AR: There's only one win: if you need a union between `i31` and some `(def)` type.

BT: The win is as big as however low you can go on the hierarchy for defining the union. However low your common supertype is.

AR: [responding to "Forward-compatible* encoding" slide] Current thinking is that type exports & generics would both be over heap types. That's a bigger discussion we probably don't want to get into today.

CW: I was thinking that in a world where we don’t make this change and wait for general union types, could we add a restricted version of union types later where the only allowed union is i31 + some heap type definition? The goals is to be forward compatible.

AR: Yes, the union is over heap types and I would expect general unions to be defined types, so defining a restricted union makes sense to me as an intermediate step.

BT: We've already put a bit in the reftype constructor for null; i31 would just be another bit.

AR: You can think about it as a bit, but it's a new constructor, and the number of constructors is exponential in the number of bits.

BT: i31 is about machine representation, it's not a user-facing type


CW: We already have an example where you want richer representation for multiple types.

BT: i31 is representable on nearly all machines and other representations would not be portable, so i31 is special.

CW: ???

AR: I don’t think anyone is suggesting unions over value types, but rather unions over heap types.

CW: Only distinction between eq and data right now is that eq can be an i31.

BT: Right now the problem is that there's no way to have an any that can't be an i31

ASC: ???

CW: In a world with the union constructor, you wouldn’t use a cast(?) you would construct a union.

BT: Union or type or heap type?

CW: Heap type.

BT: Why isn’t null a heap type?

AR: You could make null a heap type. But it has this very special role.

ASC: Having null as a separate type could be useful, that would keep us from having to specify a heap type for the null.

AR: That would be separate, adding a bottom heap type, which couldn’t be anything but null.

BT: Could it be a non-null bottom type?

AR: It would be separate because bottom is a subtype of everything else, but null is disjoint from everything else.

CW: My assumption is that enough languages will want to be using null and nullable types in such a way that it makes sense for null to be a dimension. i31 is much less generally-applicable.

AR: Agree with CW that keeping null as a separate dimension makes sense given its special role. Even within Wasm null has a special role: e.g. default value of locals.

TL: Makes sense that null is special. But this conversation is about whether i31 is special. Clearly it's somewhat special, given we don't have i63 or whatever. Why is it not special enough to be a type dimension?

CW: I think it's special enough to merit a union constructor, but not a type dimension.

AR: You could require usage of i31 to have a defined type; we don't do that because it's kind of stupid, but it would make sense.

BT: Could declare structs to also be able to be i31. 

CW: That’s what I was talking about with the special case union constructor.

ASC: I don't think it will work well for a struct type to declare itself as being also-an-i31. Since the thing you want to deal with, when it's a struct, would be only-i31.

AR: Right, you want a struct type and a union of defined-struct-type and i31.

BT: But then how do we talk about only ref types that are pointers (not i31)?

CW: That would be a union of data and func.

AR: If we had unions we wouldn't need `any` or `eq`, they could be unions with i31.

BT: I want to define any point in the space of pointer-only types and also any point in the space of tagged pointers. Want a type as specific as possible.

AR: And a union would give you that.

CW: I think the point BT was making earlier was that adding i31 as a dimension would imply the use of tagging.

AR: Special union can’t use tagging either to make a representation change.

BT: Regardless of whether it's a dimension or a possible feature of unions, you'd have to pull it out of the hierarchy.

ASC: That would be necessary to avoid checking for i31 when downcasting from eq or any.

AR: If you want to avoid those checks you can just avoid using `any` and `eq` (those are just unions).

TL: AR, you said that you couldn't use pointer tagging with these unions? Doesn't that make i31 useless?

CW: Downcasting would perform the check and could change the representation.

BT: The trouble with using a union of {data, func} is that you'd have to add anything else that gets added between `any` and `eq`.

CW: If we added unions with i31, should we get rid of eq?

AR: We could, but there are typing rules that want to refer to it

CW: I'm more saying that you wouldn't end up using `eq` for the purpose of unioning with i31

BT: If we have an i31 type, then `any` will be on top of it.

AR: Sounds like you want an any-but-i31 type? We could add such a thing if it was useful!

CW: From BT's presentation the use-case seems to be to avoid a tag check

BT: Correct

AR: Have a hard time imagining a use case with such a large union of arbitrary func and data.

BT: The not-i31 type sounds good to me, I think I could get by with that

CW: Would be the type of pointers, of untagged things.

AR: The type hierarchy would become a DAG: there'd be a new type below any, above func and data…

ASC: Depends on what you union i31 with, you might want a union with any?

TL: Sounds like two ideas to explore: 1) adding a new any-but-i31 type to the hierarchy 2) union of i31-and-something-else.

BT: We should try (1) first

AR: Agreed, (2) might not be worth it for the MVP

CW: I'd say we could add (2) whenever we want if the numbers were worthwhile.

BT: What are the criteria to evaluate whether it's worth it? I don't think V8's going to be able to avoid a tag check because of JS null & all that.

AR: Fortunately V8 is not the only Wasm engine, and there are non-JS engines that have more freedom.

AR: Have other Wasm engines now.

BT: Wasmtime has no GC implementation.

CW: Want to point out that option (1) above should be looked at closely, making the type hierarchy into a DAG seems potentially problematic

BT: I think it's a DAG under `func` already

AR: In the presence of structural subtyping DAGs are unavoidable. Do think it's worth scrutiny whether these abstract types need to be a DAG too

TL: Agreed on caution, it could make calculating least-upper-bounds harder

ASC: Going back to the defaultable discussion above, if we had union-with-i31 you could make such a type defaultable with in i31 value, rather than null.

AR: True, but I’m not sure we would want to exploit that.

ASC: It would be useful to have that union and have it be defaultable.

AR: We will have non-defaultable types, e.g. for locals, and that'd make this partially moot.

CW: Non-nullable in Wasm is different that non-nullable for the producer. Producers could define their own default value to use wherever necessary.

AR: Want a sufficiently general solution because this seems like a general problem. Raises question of which default to use if you have a nullable i31.

BT: Summary is that we can probably get away with dropping the dimension idea and adding a pointer type.

LW: Some of the complexity of the DAG came from func <: any. Are any producers using that? Originally it was for func.bind, but that has become more complicated.

CW: Agree we might able to get away without adding anything in the MVP

AR: We could remove the func <: any link…

TL: Time!
