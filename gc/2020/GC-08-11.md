[Slide presentation](presentations/2020-08-11-gc-with-two-types.pdf)

JS: Anyone interested in helping implement/prototype?

FM: I think there are people who are interested. You said that languages are doing dynamic casting anyway, can you say why that might be?

JS: couple of reasons have shown up, kotlin, e.g., potentially using arrays of anyref, to maximize flexibility in the absence of compile time parameterization. OCaml has some amount of dynamic casting.

RT: For ocaml, every function call has to cast the return type, since the wasm type system isn't precise enough to guarantee that it's not an arbitrary object. If you are given arguments, it's the same problem. Until you get to a much more precise type system, then you have to fallback on dynamic casting.

KM: confused, is it because they don’t trust the code they are linking against. OCaml is compiled with type erasure right? Normally it doesn’t have to do that.

RT: It's the trust model is the issue -- for wasm you don't trust that the type is correct. For ocaml, you trust that you have already validated the types.

KM: has to be downcasted to the shape, not that OCaml is doing it for itsel

RT: Only when compiling ocaml to wasm this is the case.

AR: explain this slightly differently, you can have monomorphic calls when compiling OCaml, there is no problem using concrete type. The problem is compiling polymorphism, don’t use monomorphization, polymorphic fn have to work for every type, needs  uniform representation. A monomorphic fn has to be compatible with it, can pass it to polymorphic HOF. In general, you have two entry points to monomorphic fns, one that expects uniform rep, unwraps, then call monomorphic. Whenever you cross the boundary between mono and poly where you have to do that.

KM: I get it, I was misunderstanding what Ross was saying. It seemed bizarre that ocaml wouldn't trust the code it was generating.

LH: Are these tagrefs arbitrarily large?

JS: tagrefs will compile down to numbers, they are type IDs. If it is a recognized/canonical type id (yet to be defined), then when instruction uses this, you get (hopefully) a specialized type rep, if not you get boxes. Opportunity cost to make things less deterministic, e.g. V8 uses 31-bit SMI, … will be an option for V8 to conditionally box integers based on your bit size.

LH: The reason I'm asking, your writeup the tag references can take any number of values from stack and package them up...

JS: Certainly a design point that can be explored … borrowed from EH proposal. Nothing to stop you to do it in a more general way, boxing up a tuple. That would force a tuple.

LH: I don't want that, because I have to worry about cost, can’t represent that easily in the compiler. In a streaming compiler, you want value stack (actual thing) to have elements of manageable size.

JS: tag.pack in this case would be a heap allocation...

LH: but that’s pretty expensive. I can do that, but not cheap.

JS: It's not intended to be cheap at that point.

LH: you can do this, but...

JS: If it turns out that that's not useful, we can remove it later.

RT: only canonical tags should not require heap alloc, non-canonical ones <cut off>

JS: This is one of the reasons that i32 didn't have a canonical tag defined, it doesn't seem like you can do a cheap canonical pack for every embedder. You may want deterministic performance, even if it's not high -- we need to explore that space and see how we can flex the performance. I wanted to provide in this MVP, users that are not performance-sensitive, they are going to use externref. There is a non-trivial cost to shipping your allocator (like rust wee_alloc), there's a market for not having to ship your allocator. This provides a way to … even if you eliminate the reference part of it, just not having malloc is useful for some customers.

FM: you view this as an MVP, elaborations in the future. In the write-up, there is talk about doing the pre-type checks, so not every access needs to do the check. Re: future elaboration, how much dynamic type checking are we signing up for on a permanent basis.

JS: Good question. I think the idea here is that, there is no promise of dynamic type inference. This is the version you use if you don't care about performance, we can expand structref. tagref can be used for interface hiding and discriminated union, maybe equivalent to Andreas's proposal. If you provide that type information, then you get performance. If you don't, you get dynamic checks. If we stay with this for a long time, or if there are cheap wins from inference -- for example assert_bounds -- inside of a function's flow you can provide the bounds to remove checks. Not sure if there are other checks possible here, probably only done if they are cheap.

RT: we looked through a number of languages, even though there are more dynamic checks, those are cheaper, and more flexible, a number of systems perform better even with the more frequent checks

JS: At least we hope they will...

AR: Amount of checks you have to do in the MVP, especially if you want a uniform representation (like a functional language will want), is kind of like a stop gap measure. Eventually we have to do something about it, need to add type params (parametric polymorphism).

JS: I agree 100%, this is the MVP, we are rapidly going to fine that people want refined types. But hopefully we can make those decisions on hard data from real-world code. e.g. 50 instructions could be removed if we had the right types.

AR: it’s not that easy though, if you are constrained in certain ways, you structure your rep in certain ways, might not map to if you have a certain instructions you can use those differently. It doesn’t compare to what you are doing now.

JS: one of the reasons why i’m excited to find out what comes up of the V8 experimentation on the full proposal. Maybe we can get data about how they differ, and find out substantial road blocks for this.

KM: Going on that, I don’t think the simplicity of the proposal removes my desire to show that any GC proposal is better than compiling to JS.

JS: I don't blame you there, at the same time I stand by my comment in the thread. There are spaces where people aren't going to want to install a JS runtime, but they are going to want a wasm gc.

KM: don’t know if <cut off>. Agree with that, I will have concerns shipping it on the web. There are probably people who don’t want to have two different runtimes. I think there’s a lot of opportunities here, despite the fact that it’s super dynamic, it can be faster than JS. Particularly maintaining deoptimization side state in JS is very expensive, kills register alloc. The assert trap is uncatchable in Wasm, then we don’t need to maintain that data, no need to keep the flow.

JS: You wouldn't want assert_bounds to throw an exception, that sounds like a terrible idea.

RT: The shape analysis and hidden class in jS, that’s telling you, when accessing a prop, which field do you look at? This thing boils it down to “look at this field”, and a tag check. We eliminate all the shape analysis and gives you what it gives you at the end.

AR: You will still get in the business of dynamic analysis that JS JITs go through. I'm a bit nervous about going that route, because we're...

JS: agree 100%. I don’t want people to heavily optimize this MVP. If we choose to ship this, i will want to iterate relatively quickly… once we ship something, there will be some people who try to use it and complain about performance. I would want to encourage embedders to resist the temptation to optimize this intermediate step. The purpose of this is to ship something that satisfies some use cases and gets us information. I’m not sure if we might ship this, if we get good enough data from an experiment to inform final design. I don’t know. That’s the crux of some challenges we had, we have great ideas and not a lot of data.

AR: That is true.

BT: We're stuck on a step before that. We haven't agreed on requirements, what are the requirements for languages, static typedness, etc.. we need to have a crisper problem statement for what we're trying to do. On a number of requirements this may not be performant enough.

AR: baseline requirement that KM mentioned is that it should be faster than JS. This might require JIT work, without which you might be slower than a JS engine.

RT: A current MVP, ocaml has to represent everything as anyref, requires many casts. Dynamism is there, already in current MVP. We're not adding dynamism, we are acknowledging that it exists and planning around it.

JS: I don’t disagree, we don’t know, it’s possible that for some langs, like C# or Java, can find a way to compile down with one option, or can compile to JS more efficiently than they can to this MVP. Personally don’t think it’s likely, even with the amount of dynamism in this, the expense is in how much indirection, cache size, working set, more than the degree of dynamic checks.

AR: I still think you have more dynamism, even in monomorphic code.

JS: it’s possible, one of the reasons I would like to see examples of what this looks like with an actual language compiled down and running.

AR: don’t disagree

BT: is there a requirement that we support statically typed languages well. Personally, the requirement Wasm GC to be a value add to Web Platform, it should serve languages that are not served well by compiling to JS, almost always static type languages.

KM: What does well mean, better than JS?

BT: more efficiently than JS in particular space, not so much runtime

TL: is it also a non-goal to serve languages that are already served OK by JS?

FM: I proposed before that we look at the most popular languages, and use that as a metric for what to do. e.g. Java is most popular language we can support, then we look at that. I would second Ben's argument, it's not just .... we need to be better than JS on speed, complexity of support. The more complex the less likely it happens.

JS: at some point we start talking about tradeoffs, it becomes a call where we want to cut that space

FM: It's not just mono-dimensional.

JS: at some point we say A and B are both important, then we have to make a call. A is better than B at some stuff, B is better than A at others.

FM: It's the object of that phrase that's interesting here. We should focus on … if you want to establish requirements then pick the popular languages for that support.

RT: a little confused by the comment, so far all the languages discussed are statically typed languages

JS: what do you mean by static type, like ML style, or C++ style,

RT: or Go, or C#

BT: Simple example is Java's object model. Unboxed primitive fields in objects.

RT: works well for compiling Java, but JVM’s object model is known to not work well for compiling a variety of other systems. Other languages are not compiling well to JVM object model, and better suited by this object model.

BS: take a step back, can drill quite deep into technical details. We are sort of disagreeing whether this is fast enough, the only way to resolve is via some experimentation. Not sure who will do this. Even though this is fleshed out, there are some missing pieces of this proposal, and also who will take on that work. Not sure if CG can mandate who can look at that, though there is some interest

JS: if spec work is needed, i can do that, flesh it out for experimental purposes. Turn it into something someone can make two implementations that are compatible. Make sure it doesn’t have overlapping opcode space with Andreas’ proposal. If that’s what people think will be necessary for experiment, I can do that. I can’t write an embedder or compiler.

BS: the other aspect of this, mentioned a couple of times, we should have requirements here. Some of these won’t be satisfied by looking at designs, but there are some reqs which we can look at the design and see that it will not satisfy it. Francis started some of that, maybe your list (BT), how well we want to support statically typed languages. We need both, experimentation and list of requirements.

RT: another useful thing… something that makes things hard to make comparison, we have no plans for how to compile languages to systems. There’s OCaml thread showing how to compile to two systems. Walkthroughs to show how to compile languages down with many interacting features.

JS: We got one recently, right?

RT: Yes, it would be good to write that up, and look it at it from this perspective too. Without running them we can see how to improve, which things do we need experiments to evaluate.

FM: would like to add a small word of caution about experiments. The cost of running an experiment is more than implementing a given proposal. Embedding it in V8, you have to address the issue of compatibility with JS. The overhead of doing an experiment in a system like V8 or SM is much higher than just implementing the particular feature.

JS: I appreciate that an experiment is not cheap. But I'd like to experiment with one other proposal.

FM: what is an experiment look like? A walkthrough is good because it is human-level, you can understand it, the risk is you don’t know if it is complete or not. E.g. for Java, you meet all of Java’s needs

BS: experiments need to answer a question, you have to start with a question. What parts of these do we believe we don’t understand yet. If we just implement the prototype, we currently have that for MVP, for new experiments we should be more directed.

JS: thing I’ve heard the most is: can it perform. Concerns about dynamic checking, although the possibility that it might be offset by the simplicity of those checks, it is not clear. I want this out of experiment: can it be made to perform. KM, when you said, needs to be better than JS, assume you mean, it can be made better than JS.

KM: I mean it, I won’t ship it unless it is already better than JS. I want a real compiler, not some toy compiler. I don’t know if… I haven’t seen anything across all languages, can necessarily perform better than compiling to JS.

JS: The reason I ask… if we do these experiments and it doesn't perform better than JS, but if we put the work in. We are not going to put into the experiment, but … do you want the experiment to show that.

KM: it’s all performance things. My experience dealing with optimization, you can have guesses, but until you actually do it, reality can be wildly off. I have experience with expecting 10% better, but doesn’t really make any difference. A lot of subtleties.

BT: point out again, taking a narrow view of performance, sounds like runtime overhead matters, space overhead also matters, easier to measure and demonstrate if it is better or not.

JS: memory or code size

BT: memory

KM: will say code size matters too

JS: looking for feedback on all 3 dimensions

RT: unrelated to specific proposals… if it turns out that performance is… if all the proposals perform worse than JS, because all of them have to have dynamic casting (or other reasons), would the assessment be that we should not ship a GC.

AK: definitely make me reassess what the goals of Wasm GC

KM: without GC, linear memory one is sort of a new language one you have the GC in, happens to line in nicely with non-gc instruction set

JS: it will be hard for us not to make code size improvement, can be worse on memory and cpu perf

KM: i can believe code size is better, JS has the upside of high information density, downside is that engine has a ton of memory overhead for JIT profiling etc, have to factor that in too

AR: static code size and dynamic code size in JIT

KM: they grow proportionally, based on experiments, each JIT tier you add, the correlated in memory use and runtime perf, you want better throughput, you have more memory overhead

BS: 5 mins left, I’m hearing a few things, we have a few hard requirements from multiple members, this needs to be better than JS, the experiment doesn’t necessarily have to be better, but we need to convince ourselves it can be better. THat’s going to be the part we need to do some measurements, we won’t be sure about code size, memory use, runtime performance. This is a good place to start. We need more experimentation here, some amount we can do with current MVP, but also need more

KM: do we also have a list of language implementations? We have browser support, at least V8 implemented the proposals. Do we have other languages that will be willing to do this?

RT: kotlin, ocaml, go, erlang

KM: Anyone from the Java compiler side? High profile language will be valuable

RT: I talked with someone from Java compiler… they had mild interest.

KM: just curious..

RT: kotlin is pretty close, that one will gauge Java

AR: I talked to some JS folks, they have JVM so they don't want to support another VM.

JS: I’m with android, some interest w.r.t. Java models, it is possible that I can drum up some interest from the Android side. So far, interested in deeper host embeddings, use native apis from Wasm, without which it's a non-starter. One reason why we are pushing some kind of GC in. The ability to have things that cross boundaries is important to Android use case.

KM: This is part of our problem, that's why I like the two-types proposal, because we can start to implement something.

JS: It is months of work for somebody, non-trivial investment

RT: volatility, how to get people to invest in something uncertain. If they compile to this, pretty much any other MVP gets accepted, easy to transition to it.

BS: out of time, next steps to do some outreach, find people willing to help out. Also start thinking about requirements, fleshing out this proposal.

JS: I’ll start working on some spec work, making it implementable.
