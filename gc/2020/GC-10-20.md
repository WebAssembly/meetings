### Discussion: Observations about Types in Wasm (Andreas Rossberg) [1 hr]

[slides](gc/2020/presentations/2020-10-20-rossberg-types.pdf)

TL: You mentioned that anyref corresponds to the top ref in the source language...

AR: not quite but similar concept u use in similar language, Java will use type Object

TL: In Java you wouldn’t literally have anyref there, you’d have something that maps to Object?

AR: if you compile Java… Java already does erasure in semantics, you don’t have this problem. Java added generics after the fact, JVM can’t deal with generics. Language is defined in a way that solves the problem for you. Not the case with C#. C# has fully reified generics, more accurate runtime type system.

TL: Would C# literally use anyref here or would it have its own type?

AR: C# would have a full generic here. It would understand generic definitions, and would instantiate generic definition at call site. Same thing happens at byte code in dotnet. It monomorphises at runtime at the JIT wrt to different instantiations of the generics, but not wrt to source, only wrt to low level representation. Something a bit in between, hard to mirror in Wasm, then you’ll need a two-level JIT. C# runtime have first JIT into Wasm, then JIT into actual native code. Which I think is something we eventually want to be able to do, but as a first step its not an impl approach, would be pretty courageous to try that.

RT: Thomas’s question is that you wouldn’t use anyref here… in the compilation of Wasm.

AR: for C# you would use type T here.

TL: in the compilation of C# to Wasm would we use anyref for the param

AR: Yeah, you probably would be using Object, that’s true.

RT: likely compile bar t here …

AR: actually won’t use Object. C# also allows you to instantiate with primitive types, e.g. int, might want to pass in i31ref for example.

RT: C# when you compile to wasm, would likely use partially monomorphized/partially not, where T becomes a runtime argument, specifying which type it is.

AR: sure but you’ll still need anyref to cover unboxed types, you probably want to be able to run with unboxed types

FM: if you have a topology of dependencies between two modules, you might introduce additional connections that are in some sense parallel. Source-level graph could be viewed as a subgraph or abstracted graph of the actual graph. If you introduce additional dependencies but they happen to flow along the lines of existing source-level dependencies...

AR: Transitively?

FM: not necessarily, between A and B, at the source-level. At that level there’s just one dependency. At wasm level, you might have a set of dependencies.

AR: I’m only talking about dependencies on the module-granularity level

FM: i mean that yea

AR: Individual entities along the edges, that set can be extended. If you have additional things like metadata, etc. that’s ok. This is only talking about edges on the whole. The interface might include additional things, different things. But you don’t want additional edges between modules.

FM: factorizable. The wasm graph must be factorizable to the source level graph.

AR: Yes, maybe. I’m not sure what factorizable means there.

FM: divide the graph

AR: partition it

FM: not quite the same, it’s like difference between a set and an equivalence class

TL: You said that this end-to-end modularity has to hold for user modules, does that observation allow for a system module that all user modules have to depend on?

AR: this is for user modules, have some backup slides on that, can discuss it now. Most languages will also have some sort of runtime, that everybody depends on. Can think of that as an ambient module in the background of everything, since you compile to that language, it always exists, factor it out of the picture.

RT: For source-linking, languages like C# that link nominally, does that mean that wasm will link nominally too?

AR: nominally in what sense?

RT: A C# module refers to classes by name, when it is linked it will use matching names.

AR: that is something your runtime system has to figure out how to do. That is mostly orthogonal to what I’m talking about. How you resolve them and how you find them is separate problem.

[back to slides]

RT: You’re referring to structural in terms of the source language’s grammar, correct?

AR: In this case these are source types yes. To go back to the example, if I want to compile those to different modules without any form of collaboration, the two types have to compile to the same thing in Wasm.

RT: I already know how to solve all that, but let’s go on.

[back to slides]

[AR displaying observation 8]

RT: You mean with the language’s structure right?

AR: as soon as you have to use Wasm cast somewhere, the same has to apply to Wasm cast.

RT: YOu can canonicalize within the language’s grammar correct? Because you already said the language’s runtime can be used to resolve it.

AR: how would the language runtime canonicalize Wasm types in Wasm?

RT: It could canonicalize the RTT’s for you… [provides example]

AR: once you show me how you implement that in Wasm, and make that accessible through a Wasm module, I believe you.

RT: OK, can do.

[back to slides]

[On slide with class C<T> { … }]

BT: Suppose that in addition to this program you have a D<T> that had the same shape as C, where you replace Cs with Ds, if you replace them in Wasm then you would have the same structure. But then you can’t tell apart Ds from Cs.

AR: Yes, if you just used Wasm canonical rtts, then not sufficient to implement this. I’m not even talking about that, i’m only making the observation that whatever mechanism has to do dynamic canonicalization at some level. The only way I can see that being… generative nature such source level types piggy back on Wasm, you need to add 2 things. 1 is primitive to create a fresh rtt, generative version of rtt.canon, not enough to instantiate it, also have the kind of parameterization, need a parameterized generative rtts. You need to have an rtt version of nominal generics.

BT: I understand the polymorphic recursion requires you to canonicalize cross-modules, because otherwise you have to look it up. But you have to do it anyway because you have to find the “seed” RTT… which means a registry. It’s implicit in the runtime or the engine.

AR: it has to be somewhere, either in the engine or in the runtime system of the language you implement. Strictly speaking, you don’t have to canonicalize, you can do tree comparisons, you don’t want to do that, want to canonicalize types. Already what dotnet engine does.

[back to slides]

CW: The kind of language that would be useful for, would be a static language with strong modularity. Do you have an example of a language like that?

AR: not sure I understand what you mean from that question.

CW: FOr example w/ Ocaml, even though you have modules it compiles down to ...

AR: this is already true for C# as I showed, by using generics you have the same problem.

CW: Doesn’t that mean that it depends when you do it? [gives example]

AR: the problem is that you can’t implement that in Wasm.

CW: can’t implement that in current MVP...

AR: if you extended the proposal with parameterized rtt fresh instruction?

CW: Imagine we go to something like… version of Ross’s proposal that has a nominal type system, extend that with RTT.fresh instruction, where you can build it in the language instead of the runtime.

AR: not sure I know exactly what you mean, my observation is , short of putting Generics into Wasm one form or another, you won’t be able to solve this problem. Because the runtime type you have to create there is essentially a generic type. You only create the class once, but you have to be able to instantiate it in a structural way with different, arbitrary parameters.

RT: We built a system where the run-time-type for arrays is not parameterized, but it can reason about arrays without it. For C# at least.

AR: that would not implement source level casts then, right?

RT: it did.

CW: you need a tagged type and bounded quantification and all that right?

RT: The RTT just tells you it is an array, not what it is an array of. The actual array has a tag to tell you what it is. A field in the array tells you which type it is, the RTT isn’t parameterized.

AR: in that case you have implemented your runtime type system yourself. This is what I said earlier, the cast mechanism and the runtime type system,... the cast mechanism in Wasm is to workaround the Wasm type system, and not to implement source level cast.

RT: This guarantees actual safety properties, you need to do it to guarantee that you could put e.g. strings into an array. It’s necessary for the safety of the system.

AR: I understand, yea right, it’s not just the source level cast.

DE: Point on observation 9: are you saying it would be anti-modular to have a central runtime, and that it’s a requirement that a different system set of modules have different runtime modules?

AR: that’s what TL asked earlier. It's fine to have a per-language central module. That’s an ambient thing in the background, because you’re running on that language. Application is a user-defined notion. Requiring a central module for that mean that modularity of individual user modules won’t translate over to Wasm. Can’t use them independently.

DE: problem is about canonicalizing across language barriers?

AR: This is a bit more high-level problem in general, not introducing additional dependencies. One way you could do this is certain ways of encoding structural types with nominal types, which would break the module topology. There might be other ways that you could break that too.

FM: another way of doing that by exposing the type definition itself, which is kind of a hybrid of nominal and structural.

CW: This is the import/export idea that was talked about recently.

FM: you’re saying that you have a type, and it must be defined in a particular structural way, exposing the constructors in Ocaml. Hybrid of structural and nominal. You’re preserving the relationship between names and their definitions.

RT: Are we trying to say one program is compiled with Java 6, and another with Java 7, they’re both shipped to the website. Does this system have to figure out how to canonicalize? What’s the problem you’re trying to solve here?

AR: I’m trying to make modularity work. Not sure what you mean by different versions of JVM.

CW: The kind of modularity you’re talking about at the source level is not often maintained...

AR: what I specifically try to make that clear by saying...

CW: restriction many structurally typed languages put on linking object code, compatible with the central module that declares in nominal/structural way.

AR: [goes back to modular compilation slide] This can’t be done with a central user module.

CW: is dotnet structurally type?

AR: with respect to generics

CW: This is the same thing to do with runtime library or canonicalizing on the side...

AR: should have made a slide about this, this suggestion also comes up a number of times. The idea that you can canonicalize on the side, two fundamental problems. 1 don’t think you can express that in Wasm, 2, don’t think you can express even the interface. 3. You’re implementing structural types in user space. Everybody would have to do that. What’s the point of doing that, you’re pushing the problem aside, everyone has to do it themselves in half-broken way… with ill-defined semantics probably. No way to express your intent in Wasm types. You bolted on the side, if you even can, I don’t know how you can do that, even if you find a way, why would you. Why not put it into the language?

RT: As Ben pointed out, C and D can be structurally identical but need different RTTs

AR: not i’m talking about. Two generic type instantiations are identified by the structure of their arguments. Not about their definitions, about their arguments.

FM: I think the response to Ben is that C and D from Wasm POV are the same, but not Java. So Java would need the additional casts.

RT: then the infrastructure needs to exist anyway.

BT: the only thing you need to distinguish c and d is to have generative rtt. Orthogonal to type system is structural or nominal.

AR: wasm type is validation and code gen. If all you care about is mapping down to Wasm, then it’s only about the RTT, and nominal and generative semantics for those. But don't’ think just generative is enough, you also need to model parameterization.

TL: out of time. Helpful if people follow up with specific questions for specific parts of this topic, for next time/future meetings.

AR: some slides left, don’t know if i should present at some other point, we can talk about other things.

TL: great for follow-up discussion.
