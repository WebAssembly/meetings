### Discussion: Follow-up Q/A on low-level GC research presentation (@RossTate) [10 minutes]

RT: two weeks ago, i gave presentation, no time to discuss, want to discuss take aways. One topic has been raised that I can follow up on.

FM: One question I have. Been a long time since SOIL initiative has been released. What's the status of that? Compared to the two-types/butterfly proposal.

RT: feedback we have gotten is that we should simplify it. Some ideas on what to do there. Designed to be forward compatible with the direction that current proposal is taking. The butterfly proposal OTOH points out some deficiencies in both that and the current mvp. Double array gives a lot of flexibility. Easy to extend those proposals with that. 

RT: There's an issue… SOIL initiative is drafted as taking these ideas and seeing what you can do with them. There's another issue that's trying to find the smallest steps. Not discussing that today because Andreas isn't here to discuss it.

RT: Because of the presentation, some people brought up issues with importing. We've been trying to go through a bunch of examples and work them out. The pattern seems to be that the examples -- in high level languages there's a difference between nominal and structural, at lower level you need something else. e.g. you need RTTs to be able to cast. So we find that the same number of imports is required for structural and nominal. Maybe discuss at another time.

LW: remember that there are a whole bunch of objectives achieved, validation time and binary size matters a lot. Trying to think if inferability, independent of the other two, matters. It allows the producer toolchain to be unmodified. What could be done is that the whole toolchain works with a set of types, then final stage shared by final steps, with †˙´ final step doing the inference. The wasm that goes over the wire is optimized for the first two objectives.

RT: That's the model that I thought made sense for Wasm. That we have a pre-wasm thing, then a common thing that fills that in on server side. then when you ship it over, it fills it in. Engines shouldn't do inference, the times are reasonable, but...

LW: Balancing act there is binary size and validation time.

RT: inferability important on the producer side, don’t think it has to be part of the Wasm standard

TL: Follow up on that. Binaryen is in a pretty good spot to be a final tool shared across the ecosystem. So if that's something we want to talk about more, we can talk about an API on Binaryen to make that easy for other producers.

RT: we as in you and me, or we as in group.

TL: we as in the group, pull in more binaryen people

BS: about at the time box, next topic

### Discussion: Resource Limits #122, #35 (@brion) [10 minutes]

BV: One of the things that I'm researching is web-based language for user-generated scripts, and I need to sandbox. There's an obvious benefit for GC proposal, one thing that worries me is that you can DoS the host, by allocating a lot of memory. Found that in JS Chrome and FF let's you allocate until system is not responsive, Safari is a little more conservative. If that's something that's still possible in wasm GC, I would worry about that. I'd like an acknowledgment that there's understood restriction, or someway to set resource limits in a specified manner and not host-specific manner. Question is, should it be possible to have resource limits on GC objects. And how to do it? I know it's difficult to add, but I think we should discuss.

FM: are you proposing resource constrained computation as an idea?

BV: something to consider, at the higher level, browsers are able to protect browser shell from JS environment, but coarse, like killing an entire process, or they don’t do it at all. It is non-trivial, otherwise browsers will do it more.

FM: The trick is to do it without losing performance.

BV: if you have to annotate +/- count on every alloc/dealloc, it may be unacceptable.

RT: Right now we have memory as a thing that has to be imported or created. Maybe you should also have to allocate a heap space, and each allocation has to say which heap space they allocate from.

BV: really like that idea, think it would be a straightforward way to implement, not sure if browsers will want to implement that

RT: I can see making that happen. It would hook into other ideas that are circulating. How easy would it be for a browser to track which space they're in. Whether they would know which space they're in.

BV: suspecting that linking objects with references between heaps will be difficult in that scenario, difficult for interoperability

LW: I've thought a little about this, about quota and resource management. Maybe there's a role for a holistic approach for GC memory, and stack, and resource that could grow unboundedly. I've seen this come up. Where there's an inner program and and outer program, and the outer program is more trusted. Wasm is pretty good here, aside from this case. Maybe a more holistic approach…

TT: also really depends on trust level, if we don’t trust a program, then you probably want to be safe from it from security, you probably wanna be safe from spectre, want process boundary with e.g. untrusted iframe. It’s not interesting as a Wasm feature anymore.

BV: At some point you can no longer call it directly, and it's less exciting.

LW: interesting use case, figma uses Wasm to sandbox plugins. Not absolutely zero trust, it’s a question which side of the line resource utilization falls on. In that case they use an interpreter.

BV: any more comments? Or out of time?

BS: is concerning that you can take down the entire browser/OS in this case. Does feel like a separate issue.

LW: taking down more than a tab seems like a browser issue.

BV: I have reported this bug to FF in the past, but it hasn't been fixed yet.

### Discussion: Requirements #121 (@fgmccabe) [40 minutes]

FM: I revised my slides from before, I can at least start that. Should I do that?

[Francis presenting slides]

[TODO(francis): link to slides]

LW: One of things I've realized talking to folks outside the browser. the need outside the browser is lower, since inside the browser you need to collect cycles across browser GC. Outside of the browser we don't care about this as much. The major consumer is browser GC, the major stakeholder to make happy is the browser. It seems increasingly likely that...

JS: two different ways i would disagree, first is that we’re seeing, e.g. WASI, designed under the assumption that GC isn’t available, to create coherent distributed lifetime between embedder and module. If this was available, they may have decided to use lifetime tracked externrefs, or some minimal GC. There’s an aspect of, if you build it they will come. The other one is that, I work in Android, one of the requisite for coherent binding, will be ability to pass objects across boundary. In the absence of this, you’ll need some kind of wasm-bindgen style shim, so far this has been unpalatable in the Android context.

LW: Let me ask follow-up… does Android currently in the design of its APIs lead to cycles between guest and host, with GC. [JS: yes, lots and lots of callbacks] That puts it in the same context as the DOM, then. It would make sense then that Android is a significant target for host-cycle collections. On the former item, as being part of the WASI discussions. The design of an API can force a host-guest cycle collection, I think we want to prevent that. Some languages can't use GC, like C, so we put C in a bad place if we have a GC requirement for the system. So I wouldn't include the first one as a motivating case.

TL: how much energy is there in the active WASI ecosystem for bringing languages that will require GC in order to target Wasm at all. Currently WASI seems focused on linear memory languages.

LW: The assumption here that is proven out by Blazor and Go, is that you can port these languages to wasm and use linear memory...

TL: in the WASI context where download size is not a big deal, perfectly acceptable

LW: We've heard from these languages that, when if we ask whether they'd use wasm gc, they say no, they want to do their own tricks, they need their own GC. So you're making a tradeoff. The benefit from the host of using a GC specific to the device… for languages that are not size-limited, not restricted by host, may choose to compile to wasm GC.

TL: wonder if we will get into a situation where the same language will compile to linear memory for WASI, but compile to GC to run on the web.

LW: With Interface Types, if WASI is expressed with Interface Types, then you should be able to use no linear memory at all, that's another design goal.

TL: related note, there was a lot of discussion in the comments of the requirements doc about how great it would be to just use linear memory and have languages bring their own GC. This came up from the OCaml and Erlang folks. If only they could collect cycles, while using their own linear memory GC. Francis, you got the impression that we shouldn’t look at this? I got the opposite impression. If we think we can solve that problem, then we should put all our resources into it. But no one has a tenable foothold on that problem, some resources put in, but none seem to end up with production quality. If someone has a burst of inspiration to make this possible, it will be good to follow up on that.

FM: Part of my reasoning was not technical. Some of the browser vendors basically expressed a hard line that we should focus on host GC first.

TL: is Keith on the call?

RT: They are concerned setting up the wrong system for wasm, where there are garbage collectors everywhere, so they don't have a good way to collect cycles.

TL: if we have a solution for the smooth collection of cycles with linear memory, they would be happy.

RT: The question is nobody knows how to solve that problem yet.

TT: even if you collect cycles, you will still ship heavy runtimes on the web.

LW: If we then say, there's a bias toward the web and Android, then as key stakeholders, then the criterion is the likelihood of bringing people to these key stakeholders, there are some languages that are based on large class libraries, that aren't going to bring a large number of people to the web. It seems like we will want to focus on these languages. That's why Java and Kotlin are interesting languages for this platform.

TT: we can look at languages that already compile to JS

FM: An alternative to popularity of languages is something that identifies adoption-ready communities, prioritizing adoption… what's most likely to spark adoption is something we could focus on.

BT: one thing i saw in the reqs doc, java and python came up on top on the TIOBE index. Both will require a significant runtime language, will need JITting and late binding. Need to think about that as a possible architecture. Now we have whole prog compilation, offline translation and lowering. Need to think about phrasing, expect runtime systems on Wasm, need to think about that when we think about requirements.

FM: I agree completely, and I also think that GC isn't the only thing that's stopping Java or Go adoption. But we can't solve all of the problems, are brief is to look at GC, not solve Java. Eventually we'll het to Java, but having GC is not enough. I agree that support for Jitting is important, several of us have been thinking about how to do that. I'm OK with focusing on adoption as a criteria. It makes it explicit what we're trying to do.

LW: I will push back a bit on the JIT aspect, hard to do a good JIT on a small amount of bytes. We don’t want them shipping their own JITs. For thinking about immediate adoption on Web, sub-100k download size. Whole program compilation and maximal AOT will be the winner in the short-term, to be competitive with JS in size.

BT: I'm thinking more broadly in terms of … yes, you don't want to have every language bring a JIT. So you have to think about what can make it usable. You want the engine to do the work. We need to be able to reuse the wasm execution tier. Part of this is cloudy, but part is more clear after some of the work I've done here.

RT: in the middle space, being able to ship programs components-by-components. People will find that useful, you can do whole program compilation, but can send components to get faster loading.

BT: We should maybe talk about the fidelity of language support. Plenty of solutions that compile Java to JS, they aren't completely language compliant, cut corners. So we should think about what is the end-goal. Are we going to support all of the JDK compliance tests. Maybe we should have a clause about fidelity.

FM: will push back against that, it’s up to the Java community to decide what the fidelity they are looking for

BT: Here's the thing, some of those things are really hard. They need specific mechanisms. Some are really hard to support. It may impose requirements on us to get to 100%.

LW: specifically for the references, we can’t expect to support 100% of these industrial strengths, there’s just too many. We have to assume we hit a subset of each particular language.

FM: having an adoption criteria will square this circle. We may not need all of the Java community, we just need some fraction of the community. The more esoteric feature… I would argue that, if Java needs a given feature, it’s up to a Java rep to come to us and argue the case. We are motivated to get as much adoption as possible, for any given feature, it’s up to the community of the language to argue their case.

TT: I don't think it's about languages, it's about users. There are users who are happy with compiling to JS, and the question is about how much effort to port.

AK: q for FM, what do you see as the future of this reqs doc. How will it change over time? Will it become a common thing at meetings, with PRS to amend requirements.

FM: Two roles, first is to get as clear up-front about what the problem we're trying to solve is. Someone who's coming in later on can use it to get up to speed. Also, I hope that it helps take the steam out of some of the discussions. It is a living document, and we have to be ready to change. Sometimes the change means that the problem we're solving is different. I don't foresee a ton of changes to the requirements document. But requirements do change, so when that happens we should reflect that in the document. It is something that shows to someone from the outside what problem we're solving.

RT: we’re not supporting any GC.. prioritize widely used features. That might more directly address what you’re trying to achieve.
