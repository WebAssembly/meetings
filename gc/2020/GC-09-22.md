### Discussion: [Incorporate RTTs into the type](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/119) (Ross Tate) [20 min presentation, 20 min discussion]

Ross presenting "Minimal Change to Nominalize the MVP" [(pdf)](presentations/2020-09-29-tate-nominalize-mvp.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2020-09-29-tate-nominalize-mvp.pptx)

LW: I get the general tension between i31ref and smi -- what if the engine doesn't need to distinguish them?

RT: specs will because JS SMI is conceptually a JS integer, it’s not supposed to  cast to an i31ref

LW: The idea is that the coercion when the i31 flows in can put it into an i31ref...

RT: you’ve picked a winner in Wasm that will always use i31ref, to interact with Wasm it would convert to Wasm mode

LW: No, it would just happen at the toWebAssembly interaction -- it would not be observable at the JS boundary.

RT: formally in terms of abstraction it is compatible, an alternative is an externref, not a subtype of anyref, i don’t need to do any coercion

LW: Do what? A coercion happens in any case, it happens when a JS value flows into Wasm.

RT: we can do all sorts of coercion at boundary, if externref is not subtype of anyref, you don’t need any coercion

LW: Specifically for SMIs, I don't see a conflict where anyone is getting deoptimized. I don't see a tension for this one.

RT: move on to other examples first

[back to slides -- Centralizing Coordination]

AR: coordination for types is not the same as for exceptions, exceptions are generative in source language, nominal aspects map down

RT: Wait, the generative source in source language are not the same as generative source in Wasm...

AR: in that case it's even easier, either it’s a finite set (C++) or translated down from nominal in source language. Completely different from types. If you compile two modules that use structural types, there is no central instance to define the infinite set of types.

RT: I'll get to all this later… plan to have more discussion after that.

[back to slides -- Centralizing Coordination]

FM: Assertion you have about coordination is not generally applicable. In particular in systems like Java application servers, this a central module but the application server has no knowledge of the applications that it's serving. It's not true that this runtime module can know everything about the application -- it's not knowable.

RT: doesn’t have to know everything, if you have app server and exchange strings, all those strings need to be tagged with rtts.

FM: It's true for strings, but not for other types involved...

RT: Should be for other types as well… 

FM: thats why i said tree, it’s not one node that knows all the type, you have a tree of a graph

RT: That's still fine, if I have modules that have the same type, they need to link with the same module that provides that type.

FM: there are scenarios where it’s a distortion to force this, having a central module that knows about all the types

RT: I'm not forcing them, there are other ways to arrange that coordination.

AR: confused about what you said, whole point of rtt.canon is that no coordination for runtime types

RT: You also said that rtt.canon is not excpected to be used for OO languages

AR: if you map something already nominal in source language, this is about compiling something that is not nominal in source

RT: If one module has a string and another has a string, then something needs to coordinate on the RTT

AR: they need to have out of band agreement for what a string representation is.

RT: We explicitly discussed what happens when two structures have the same struct, you said they'd have different RTTs. So are we doing that or not? If not, then we need to add another layer to casts...

AR: not sure i follow the question, there are several levels here, primary use case of rtt is to allow representation level cast, the next kind of thing is how you can piggyback this mechanism to represent/imply source level cast (which can be nominal), we can support that by supporting a generative way to support rtt (rtt.new), we have discussed it. What source semantics is implies what rtt you will be using.

RT: Andreas, it is difficult to take anything concrete since there are not translations for source languages. You said there is a way to make generative RTTs and a TODO. Operating on that response, that's what I'm suggesting.

AR: that’s why i just said, you would have a new rtt.new

RT: Yes, if you have this then you have to communicate shared types.

AR: only for types that are nominal in the source language

RT: the example i gave is Java strings.

CW: Java will need this yes, but the question

AR: with the set of types they can define infinitely many types. For java you have a small fixed set. In general, with a language that lets you define infinite structural types. Even managed CPP, array types are structural, you can’t predefine infinite set of array types.

RT: Can you give me concrete language examples where this couldn't be supplemented with wrapper types?

AR: maybe C# is one example, structural array types

RT: C# arrays are nominal

AR: structural in element type

RT: in casting system it is nominal

CW: I was thinking ocaml, but we need to compile to array of anyrefs, we won’t be able to use this

AR: true in MVP, but not what we want in the future. Ocaml relies on uniform representation, you don’t want any more fancy. The standard examples are arrays and tuples. Not sure what you’re saying that they are nominal in CLR/C#, there is a generic type constructor.

CW: I guess more generally, not just Java or C# that has a need to have a central coordinating module, then you need the module for other reasons. A better example is one that doesn't need a central coordinating module.

AR: the other problem is that, if you have infinite set of types, e.g. tuples

RT: e.g. for ocaml system, with tuple system, tuples are only done up to some size, then turned into arrays, supposed you don’t do that. You can have applications dynamically load this module, link with the standard module anyway, provide standard sizes up to arity 10 tuples. For larger, loader can generate a tiny module that makes rtt for length 11.

AR: You have basically greenspun a structural representation...

RT: for languages that need this construct… <cut off>

AR: cannot be a Wasm module, have to be outside of Wasm. It would have to reflect on..

RT: talking about a theoretical system that doesn’t exist

BS: feel like we have spun off, let’s get back to the main issue

<Back to slides, Understanding rtt.canon (and rtt.sub)

CW: The RTT.canon instruction, not necessarily but at runtime you'll have to do that.

RT: will work on that...

<Back to slides, Understanding rtt.canon (and rtt.sub)

[discussion about whether the complexity is the same between structural and nominal types]

CW: not sure if you saw discussion with RT, each immediate parent lists all its transitive parents, only need to import immediate parent

RT: meeting is now recorded (adamk said in chat)

CW: in all of RT system, when you import definition, you get all the fields including parents, don’t need transitively import all of parents

RT: There's an open issue on this, Andreas. But Conrad and I had a long discussion about this...

AR: but you’ve moved to a more structural thing

CW: You need to do a linear check at each level of inheritance.

[Back to slides -- Concerns with structural typing]

AR: can you explain what you claim to be undecidable

RT: There's an issue where we've gone over this already. At the present the post-MVP is not specced enough so it could be useful for anything. The only way to extend it to make it useful for some examples made it undecidable. Other people have tried this before, and were not able to make it work for Java and C# arrays.

AR: I think I have to remark on something again. The primary purpose of casts is to do representation. I don't think it's possible to do source level casts, it would be a universal type system.

RT: you’re making a slippery slope kind of thing, we aren’t going to be able to represent all. There are existing systems, like c# arrays, you can  reason that a Java string array can only contain strings. We can’t guarantee all things, but we shouldn't try to at least guarantee some things, need a middle ground

AR: Agree with that. Disagree about the reasonable middle grounds.

[Back to slides -- concerns with structural subtyping]

BS: we are still doing the lead-up to the change, how many slides?

RT: few slides left.

AR: dynamic type system intentionally supports both structural and nominal. Currently what’s written down is purely structural. If you consider the extension then it supports both

RT: It's the case that a value -- we can't in the current MVP cast functions to funcref, because it isn't a structural system. Currently the plan is that the function will be tagged with the canonical type for its ref, which is not funcref. Also not subtypes of functions, so it must be a nominal system.


CW: I have a question: your point about the casting of "this" pointer, in both nominal and structural systems you need this cast, but with bounded quantification you can prevent this [RT: correct] Have you looked at other systems to remove this?

RT: probably some I have missed, i’ve tried going through a bunch of them, and found that, e.g. AR linked to some of them, none of them are expressive enough. We can go through each case and see what each misses.

BT: While we're on this slide: every "this" pointer must be cast? Tobias proposed a mechanism where you could do method dispatch using hashtables, we should not take it as an assumption that we need this cast, where we can do it implicitly… I'm pointing out that this current set of capabilities makes it impossible, but we can get around it by adding new features.

RT: wasy to get around in the future but in MVP we can’t.

TT: But bounded quantification is not necessary, as the object systems demonstrate. There are example with no cast for this, by hiding the dispatch in an abstraction

RT: If build toward a specific language then we can bake in the invariants of that language, we can bake in C# and Java Arrays, so we know that the values extracted from the array have a specific type.

TT: you can also try to find mechanisms that are more general, not language specific

RT: Right, it's an open problem. Existential types may not be the only solution, just the only one I know it exists.

[Back to slides -- Suggestion]

BT: Removing anyref is not related to the nominal type system. There's downsides to removing anyref, it means you need type imports for parametric polymorphism. Anyref is a way to achieve ad-hoc polymorphism.

RT: we gave concurrent examples of how to have polymorphism without anyref

BT: For example, if you think of anyref being java.lang.Object, before generics they are the top type. If you were to build generic objects today in Wasm, you'd build them using anyref.

RT: you can make a module that declares a nominal type that does not have anything in it (e.g. Ocaml)

BT: Without a top-type, you cannot build a generic data structure unless you force every other data structure to extend it.

RT: the thing i described will be the top type for ocaml modules

BT: You're not understanding my example, a generic anyref usable for any language.

TT: either you box them or its part of… <cut off> it’s not possible to have an array....

AR: I agree with Ben that removing anyref is orthogonal to the rest of the discussion. If you don't have anyref… it's just the infinite union. You either need unions or variants for generic data structures. Variants are not enough because we don't have closed world.

RT: who needs this?

AR: if you compile any language and you want to talk to WASI, import abstract types, infinite set, you cannot, at compiler construction type, say what this set is. You need that in your representation somehow.

RT: Import WASI type, then you have something that says how to represent the WASI type.

BT: there’s an implicit assumption that people disagree on: how reusable can we make Wasm module, are they only for a specific language, if yes then we have a module that coordinates runtime, define top type of Ocaml. I do not have this assumption, people will build generic modules. I want to build a tensor library, zero dependencies, usable from any language. Can’t do that if we have to coordinate, and define top types. I can define a union using an imported type, supertype, boxing, but this is a fundamental tension. Are we going to be able to build reusable modules?

RT: Didn't you just answer that you'd use type imports for this?

BT: we don’t have the type import mechanism yet. We have that as part of the GC proposal.

KM: How do you have any two modules do this without type imports?

BT: go back to 1995, like Java, anyref.

KM: how do you downcast?

BT: don’t need to downcast, hashmap doesn’t downcast. You downcast in user code. I’m not proposing it’s an awesome solution, but need to have a solution.

BT: what i was getting at is that are we going to build reusable modules, and what mechanisms to achieve that.

CW: can do that with nominal type system with anyref. More interested in discussion the core nominal and struct system. The core is avoiding canonicalization.

AR: I think there's a conflation of issues here: main issue with canonicalization is that equi-recursion. It is not strictly necessary that structural types imply equi-recursion. We could define iso-recursive semantics, but doesn't have the problem that Ross sees. There are solutions that are orthogonal to structural vs. nominal. They are going to be the interpretations that you have to do at the module boundaries anyway. So we'll need an iso-recursive...

CW: big diff between shallow struct check and a full canonicalization, difficulty of canon on different threads

RT: Canonicalization is one aspect. At present we don't have a mechanism to do things without frequent dynamic casts. It's possible we'll develop a new system that can do this. It's possible that we solve a long-stadium open problem on how to make structural checking.

CW: i like my more specific point to be address (canon and concurrency)

BT: canon is still an optimization, you can represent … don’t think that’s fundamentally unsolvable

CW: I'm not worried that it's unsolvable, you could have data structure with lock around it.

LW: iiuc, it’s only when we get to the function level generics, we have to do anything after instantiation type, type imports. If not using type imports or structural type, you can do that at compile time. Right?

AR: Whenever you have a closed type you can do it.

BT: if rtt will be generative, with type imports you need to fill out structures, allocation.

AR: Tobias and Jakob and I discussed similar topics last week. We realized that one problem with static nominal types, if you want to compile Java -- compiling each class file into separate modules. In Java, as with other OO systems, these classes can be mutually recursive. In Wasm we don't support this. So if your nominal types are static, then you need recursive linking to make that work...

RT: recursively defined types, doesn’t matter nominal or structural. You’re saying recursively defined types are difficult, only in separate modules.

AR: if you don’t care about abstracting, all you care about is the definition…

BT: Java’s type system will never work until you have a runtime system, everything is mentioned by name.

AR: if you want to make that work at Wasm level, then runtime types have to be a form of dynamic system.

CW: tiny point, not sure the details of this proposal with examples, but this represents a very small change in terms of technical effort. TL mentioned alternative prototyping. This would be a small experiment.
