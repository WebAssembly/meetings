### Presentation: Layered runtime systems (Ben Titzer) [1 hr]

Ben Titzer presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HaxcyHoKle79koLfqhpLKil24w_98GXZGwsZFJo-qxE). ([detailed paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14T8RPgQKztURiHmzyP_Ju2S9nrIZWDaAb8eSx3NiiYw))

RT: When do errors (e.g. NoSuchFieldError) happen? Is there flexibility?

BT: There is some flexibility. JVMs have their own compatibility problems. The spec allows throwing these earlier, but some programs depend on catching them at run time.

AR: IIRC, the Java spec allows for doing these any time before the relevant instruction is executed. Could happen at different times in all different engines, eagerly or lazily.

BT: Yes, and you can even generate your own classes and use class loaders at runtime, so this is all observable.

---

RT: To clarify, you’re not handling the Java code itself creating and loading new .class files? That would require a .class-to-wasm compiler in the runtime.

BT: Yes. That doesn’t require a Java bytecode interpreter in the runtime, though. A transpiler is sufficient.

--- 

RT: How do you express covariance of arrays?

BT: Use subtype imports.

RT: Enumerate finite types?

---

FM: AALOAD has a different type argument. Are you going to import it multiple times?

BT: Yes, it will be imported once for each different type it is used with.

---

CW: How does the invoke mechanism work with the `this` object?

BT: The dispatch to the correct type is hidden in the implementation.

CW: What about a method that takes a superclass called on a subclass?

BT: There is a Jawa-level check when a class is defined that all the receivers have the correct type.

RT: This doesn’t say anything about how Wasm can reason about that relationship, though.

BT: Correct.

---

SK: Why is this better than just passing class files?

BT: No need for a class parser.

RT: What about cross-instruction optimization?

BT: Up to the Wasm engine’s JIT optimizations.

RT: But in Wasm GC there won’t be any additional optimizations?

BT: There could be; it’s up to the Wasm engine. This is a problem with any dynamic code generation. The tier below needs to optimize any generated common subexpressions.
