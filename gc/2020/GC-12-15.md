[On Decidability of Nominal Subtyping](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1714&context=cis_papers) by Kennedy and Pierce, 2006

<RT presenting>

FM: If you have a disjunction and one of the disjunctions is undecidable, it’s not necessarily undecidable on the whole.

RT: Yes, the paper goes into details.

KM: In the “or”, why does it always start at the first string?

RT: That’s the string that is found so far and we are potentially adding more.

FM: There’s a closed world assumption here that these are all the subtyping relations ships.

RT: Yes. We have multiple instantiation (implementing the same interface multiple times with different type arguments).

PC: This seems to require only one direction of variance?

RT: Yes, only needs contravariance. Covariance and invariance can be implemented in terms of contravariance.

[Java Generics are Turing Complete](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/58183/7/javats.pdf) by Grigore, 2017

CW: Previous result replied on contravariance + multiple instantiation inheritance. Does this second proof refine that result or does it require additional Java mechanisms?

RT: Yes, this only needs contravariance + single instantiation inheritance. Java has other mechanisms that cause additional decidability issues.

CW: Expansive-recursive types are not the same as equi-recursive types?

BT: In nominal subtyping, you can’t have a recursive interface inheritance but in structural subtying you can, so this doesn’t seem to be an if-and-only-if?

RT: Only for those particular structural types that encode the nominal types.

[Getting F-Bounded Polymorphism into Shape](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/shapes/shapes-pldi14.pdf) by Greenman, Muehlboeck, and Tate, 2014

LW: One aspect of structurality is that no one has to “own” a type. That seems separable (and desirable) from which types are subtypes of other types. Are these separable?

RT: The issue is -- there are lots of notions of isorecursion -- Given two isorecursive systems, you have to figure out whether they correspond to each other. Not sure how decidable that is.

LW: So it is not a priori undecidable!

RT: You don’t want to derive information from the structure.

LW: Yes, I can see that trying to derive information from the structure is where things get undecidable.

RT: There is investigation into this space, but I haven’t seen a convincing proof yet. Even if it is possible, it is certainly complicated. More complications coming next week that make these tricks work less well.
