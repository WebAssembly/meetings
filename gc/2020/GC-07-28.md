[Talking about hash maps / identities]

AR: I'm not sure that I share your assessment that most languages need identity. Even for OO types, languages with tuples would not have identity.

TT: Right, that's why it would be an opt-in feature.

LW: Do you need something separate than identity for hashes?

TT: Not in the spec, but if you need to put an object into the hash map you can't use pointer.

LW: Isn't that an implementation detail?

TT: Yes, but to do so you need to add it to the header, which may be something you don't want to pay for.

FM: there’s more to it, take Java for example, hash in java is a user-definable function, you implement it yourself. If you were compiling Java to Wasm GC, you will compile these hash functions. You have to make sure now that the hash value that the Java class has implemented, is going to be the same as the hash value that JS sees. I don’t see how you can do that if you bake it in at that level.

RT: I don't know enough about how this is done in JS -- but there's an issue filed on this topic. There's system.identityhashcode, but it's not implemented with a field of hash code. Instead there's a weak hash map that's maintained, so for objects that are asked the VM stores it in the table and stores it for you. It's provided on demand.

SK (chat): Java has a notion of identity hash code. It is used by default if you don’t override hashCode(): int

FM: talking about two kinds of hashes... if JS applications see the hash value, it should be the same “normal” hash value that Java applications see it

TT: I'm not sure they actually need to be the same. But you at least need some kind of identity to implement maps and sets. But many languages expose this value as some kind of pointer identity. What you want is that JS maps/sets expose as identity. Given that languages expose the identity code, you need to expose that...

FM: should drop the hash code from the phrase. From average Java POV, you’re just doing pointer comparison.

RT: Java has a class called weakidentityhashmap, which uses hash codes for lazy fields/on-demand fields.

AK: this question is very specific to map and set in JS, implementation specific, can dig into it a lot but maybe should move on for now.

TT: Right, separate discussion. We can move on.

RT: certainly dig into at some point.

[Tobias goes back to "Alternative" slide]

FM: Comment + question. You talk about wasm GC as language, but it isn't really, it's target of many different languages. So you're really talking about interop between Java + JS, etc. Each one of those languages has their own strategy for doing stuff. The question is, did you look at -- some of the issues you talked about are reminiscent of Interface Types. Have you looked at IT at all, in particular for attaching methods.

TT: I have not, but will be curious to learn how this would look like.

FM: The main difference is that we're not attaching stuff to data. Everything is done through an adapter structure that lifts the semantics from your language to some common language. It won't give you everything, e.g. we don't provide access to cyclic structures. Some of the principles are -- the style is different to the RTT -- but I think it more accurately reflects the language interoperability problem. You don't know what the other side is doing until you have a more limited style of interoperability.

AK: one of the use cases TT raised, you do know the surface language is the same, the one generating code knows both sides. Second one of the initial slide, you have a compile to JS app that you are transforming into compile to Wasm.

FM: I do think that's an important use case, but I think that we shouldn't use that to modify wasm in itself. You're talking about compiling Java to JS, but there's a more general problem, taking a JS application...

TT: you could extend your Java to JS compiler to also target Wasm GC for some parts of it. This one compiler can cut a boundary wherever it wants to make sure interop works. JS itself will be a reasonable denominator.

FM: No, if you're a Java bigot (which I'm not), then JS is just a target. The language I'm trying to port is Java and not JS.

LW: different and compelling use case. TS or Flow, permanently output both JS or Wasm, depending on how much you opt in to static typing. Existing languages need to output JS because they are dynamic. A TS app can have some modules JS or some modules Wasm, in a transition period.

FM: right, is this a reason for modifying Wasm?

LW: I think there are a number of ways to achieve that goal.

SK (chat): Could we also have computed JS properties on Wasm objects by adding special get/set functions on RTTs?

ZB:(chat): Have you considered having an ability to add “interceptors”? In other word “accessors”.

TT: That's something we thought about. I didn't present it now, but technically we could do that.

AR: this is the problem, you’re pulling the JS object model in there. This is what dynamic languages would need, I am skeptical of that claim. THere are many instructions there very specific to JS. First the methods, this is OO. then named properties, and ability to put named properties on any object including arrays, JS-specific probably… That’s one part of the problem I see, another is, what do these instructions mean? They don’t really have meaning within Wasm, how do we describe what they mean. Another instance of the case of, intrinsics. You want something to be able to use in the language which is not really part of the language itself, no meaning, but you want it to be efficient somehow. My feeling is that we should be solving that problem, then it might be a neat use case for adding intrinsics if you want to interop with JS, for e.g..

TT: In principle I think I agree. Independently, I think this is solving a problem we have in browsers. So I think we need some kind of answer. I'm not saying adding instructions is the only answer, but we need some answer.

RT: this is an important problem. Trying to play with the ideas. What are your reasons why creating a prototype for objects upon it leaving the Wasm module is a bad approach… Easiest thing to do without your stuff is, export some ref to a structure, JS takes that and it’s a raw structure, no prototype. Then make an object that is a pointer to the struct and has a prototype for accessing a struct. Involves making a wrapper. Why is that so problematic? Want to hear your reasons.

TT: It would be really nice if it was zero overhead. Wrappers are a problem if you need to pass them back and forth. If you pass and forth you need to re-wrap, or have them point in both directions.

LW: you want to know what’s the right shape/map/structure to use on construction of the object. You have to thread that to the allocation instruction, one way or another.

TT: The only alternative to this -- the alternative dosn't really need this. It requires RTT having identity, but later you can add the information to it. But it has its own problems.

LW: an alternative… if we assume rtts have some js api reflection, runtime object that represent wasm export rtt, we need those in any case, probably a way to construct a wasm type, construct an rtt from js using js api. If we have to have those anyway, wil it be okay to say JS construct RTT, from the JS api, you can say what is the prototype to use. From wasm perspective it’s just an rtt that is imported, struct new with that rtt. That’s how you wire it up. You incur some run-once overhead with this. But with hidden classes it’s not free.

TT: I was actually referring to hidden classes that you use to create object literals for example. JS incurs additional cost for this in many places.

LW: you suppose that can be where we start. Then optimize it. As a baseline we can synthesize rtt in JS, set them up, import in wasm, that’s a starting point.

TT: It's possible, but there are other problems. I suggested that methods should be wasm functions. In this proposal you wouldn't have reasonable access by default. It sounds like you're making it into an array (numeric access to wasm fields)...

LW: That’s something we can tweak, how does one write these methods/accessors. They can be tiny little shims that can be inlined, how can I write a method shim in JS that then does the real access to the Wasm object, and what even is the real access? Don’t like the array access, it’s too public-y.

RT: A variant on the idea is that you can import RTT that represents JS layout. It has identity, etc. When people make sub-RTTs of that, in wasm, the engine can generate prototypes for them Afterward, people can modify those to add fields to RTTs, but they know that those are all safe because they type check.

TT: I tried to avoid prototypes for everything. All The methods and properties are done without using prototypes, making them easier to optimize. Want to mention 1 more thing, i was talking about methods because it’s hard to produce RTT on JS side, you can’t refer to Wasm before you have the module.

LW: I would assume that the wasm object takes the receiver as the first parameter, and the glue code would pass "this" as the first argument, in the glue function.

TT: you still have the problem, export something from Wasm... because you use late binding mechanism of JS. A lot more direct if you just have everything together. If you directly export fields without any additional shim, e.g. first tiers in JS (interpreters) can already optimize that. If you always go through getter setter, worse performance until you JIT.

RT: Another thing is -- there are wasm modules, and in interface types that are adapters. There could be specific ways that you could interface with JS. There is a way that you could hook in, this requires you to hook in directly with the wasm module itself. You could imagine that there is a RTT mapping, but maybe in the JS "code", so you could use this instead.

TT: you don’t get this kind of lazy initialization as you construct rtt. Global initializers, you create RTT and JS view right at the same time, you don’t have to run any code until then. Any solution that doesn’t hook into the global initializers won’t have this property.

LW: Speaking to the earlier point about fast data access. If we're saying that the types and RTT are constructed from the JS API, then you can imagine that when you describe the structural layout, you can describe the name. Then you can give public property names to them, and then they wouldn't have a shim.

TT: True, you could do this same thing. But for methods you would always need a shim because of late binding.

LW: right, probably get inlined.

TT: From implementation perspective, adding these instructions is not complicated. Should be part of a bigger discussion. These instructions make sense at the moment for browsers. It would be fine if just browsers implement them.

RT: There's also the intrinsic idea, that Andreas was mentioning earlier.

TT: I think you generally know when you're shipping for browser, or not. You usually know when you're shipping in module.

FM: not quite accurate, there are scenarios where computation may be run in the server or browser, that’s a choice made relatively late at runtime.

TT: Sure you could have modules that don't have JS interaction -- but when you write the module you know when you're interacting with JS or not.

RT: currently that’s the case, will that always be the case? Will people compile Wasm and have it work in a variety of settings or compile specifically to the platform they are targeting. That's why we have embedder specific adaptors. Think you have interesting ideas, trying to work with you to play with ideas and combine them with constraints in the space.

BS: wanted to mention this comment in chat: “How about to be able to define whole shape  simultaneously? (w/o intermediate RTTs)
Maybe even define it statically” - ZB

TT: proposed mostly for simplicity. You can also have more complex form, a section describing tree shape of complete thing, then single instruction to write everything at once. A complication instruction that takes all the information as an immediate. Easiest to present this way but not necessary the best.

ZB: another question, have you considered having an ability to add interceptors, something like accessors.

TT: yes, in the earlier version of proposal we had that, I don’t see any technical reasons you couldn’t have it. Similar to method, you can install something like a getter, that actually calls a Wasm function. The reason why I presented it this way is because having the JS interpreter fast, simple case fast, you want directly readable and writable fields without any calling.

LW: can it be useful for JS to create/consume GC objects even without Wasm around. Just wanting to use these as objects that are more JIT optimizable, maybe want stricter typing.

TT: I would like that. I think that's missing from JS language. Can't comment on how difficult it would be to get through ES, but I would like it.

RT: like the typed objects paper

LW: if it was in JS, a first class extension to the class syntax to declare this with extra keywords… when you think about that, how does that interact with Wasm, use that only, or with Wasm?

BS: probably a good place to leave it. Thanks TT. Continue discussion on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/107).
