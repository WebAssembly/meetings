### Discussion: Criteria/Requirements for Linear memory GCs

FM: The number one criteria that I would like to focus on is popularity, using the TIOBE index. For linear GC, the critical factor of being able to resolve cycles between the host and the modules. If we don't do that, we're not really solving the problem. There are some requirements that don't seem that applicable. If the host is not going to do much for GC… but if you're deploying a language on the web and you can't resolve the cycles, then everyone is going to have the same problem.

FM: I've thought about this -- the first question is whether we'd want to support it, and if we did then it would be how to handle cycles. Can we design features such that a language implementer does not have to use the shadow stack to use their own GC?

FM: There's another thing that's worth talking about: I've heard people say that it needs to be competitive in performance, especially w.r.t. comparisons with JS. It is important, but it's putting the cart before the horse. You can view the programming language as a guest in the browser, and guests should behave themselves. Ross and I have been working on stack walking, this would be part of it, but it isn't solved by our proposal.

KM: related, is there an interaction with safepointing of various browsers gc? Browser GCs for the most part are fully concurrent, anywhere anytime, not clear that any random GC can respond to requests to scan itself at any time. The other thing that would be good as a criteria, for all GC proposals, will be a shame if we implemented Wasm GC and JS still seem a better target for compilation. Can consider this more as we discuss more. If we get to the end of the road and we don’t have an answer, then we have done a disservice. A lot of downsides to compiling to JS, dynamic, overhead.

RT: I should also point out that performance isn't the only reason to compile to something beside JS. JS has monkey-patching, it removes their abstractions. we shouldn't have something that's a worse target than JS, but performance isn't the only thing.

KM: if we ended up with GC being worse for some particular language that they end up going to JS, then we definitely done something wrong. Those are things against JS, and even with those, they decide to go JS then we would have failed.

FM: You're predicating failure before we've started.

KM: I'm predicating one failure -- there's a huge range of outcomes, I'm trying to describe a high-level goal, that for as many languages as possible, to make it better to compile to wasm than to JS.

FM: when you say any language, that’s a very difficult and amorphous target.

KM: I changed my perspective back to "as many languages as possible", we can't enumerate all programming languages...

FM: should be countable

KM: quantum programming language?

FM: any discussion in the various proposals that makes you think that there’s a risk associated with this

KM: Of preferring to compile to JS?

FM: ya

KM: nothing concrete, if the overhead of interacting with the host GC causes large pauses, that’s something that has been optimized a lot, entire benchmarks around preventing GC pauses, chrome + safari have concurrent GCs, the entire purpose is to prevent GC pauses. If linear memory GC provided can do that, interact with it in some way, it will be great.

JS: I'm not sure if there's another proposal aside from Wouter's that shows a linear memory GC?

RT: been thinking about the problem, hoping to ask questions and get some insights into what the problem looks like more concretely. Cycles, turns out different cycles can be solved differently. Understanding this in more detail will be more useful.

JS: I'm also interested in knowing what is a pointer, where small integers are indistinguishable from pointers.

RT: the high level is that the application is responsible for that. The questions I came up with was: things like Keith brought up. They run on different timelines, linear memory gc will do it’s thing on the application timeline, at the same time at the concurrent gc, a lot of algorithm don’t work so well when different parts of gc work on different timelines, outdated information. People have brought up that there currently is problem with cycles happening. Can someone give me a more concrete picture.

KM: I don't know every conceivable cycle in browser -- the ones I've fixed are wrappers…

RT: concretely with Wasm having references in tables causing cycles

KM: Right now the DOM has its own collection strategy, it is a reference counted garbage collector (or some other) and JS has its own too. What goes wrong, is if the reference count edge anywhere, it's a root, so if you see it your'e stuck. One solution is to try really hard not to do that, which is Safari does AFAIK. The other one is you have cycle detection, I think that's a better answer for a browser with cycle detection. They generally occur because you have wrapper objects that reference something higher up in the tree, and it makes a loop, and when you detach the tree it creates a hard edge that can't be collected. It's more tractable with multiple GCs, but I think someone from Google can probably answer it better.

AK: chrome has spent many years trying to fix this, we have cross tracing gc, the solution was basically have 1 gc.

KM: What were the kinds of issues?

AK: yea, the two graphs didn’t know about each other

KM: It's easier because you have two explicit GCs, so you can solve the safepointing with one well-defined set of GCs, as opposed to another GC that don't know about each other, where the browser and the application can't work together.

FM: that sounds like an obvious, there’s a fix in there, we add a safepoint instruction to Wasm that we would rely on.

KM: You could probably do something like that, but when the browser scans … at least for us, we can mark objects without safe-pointing, we only need a safepoint to do the flip.

RT: few ways to take the linear problem and break down solution strategy, the most complete one would be likely have application provide the host gc some way to navigate the application’s linear memory. Whether that’s practical, is an important problem, but it’;s one strategy. Another one is how to specify information such that browser GC can interpret it without running custom code, some sort of handoff between browser and Wasm, communicate live objects in this way, challenges here due to distinctions in timeline and spirals, maybe it’s an imperfect solution that can work reasonably well for coarse applications, things where applications don’t tend to have direct references. Two high-level, more complete solutions. Less complete one is to not collect all the cycles, just do the easy cases. Tell the application that we’re no longer using the handle anymore, and Wasm removes reference from the table.

FM: The last one sounds like resources...

RT: what keith mentioned with the roots, just linear memory, has not externrefs, refs are all in the tables, a browser can say, ignore linear memory, just use table. The issue here is, application is responsible for clearing table when it doesn’t need refs anymore. It can do that for its own GC. Problem is that these programs are giving out callback information, their GC then have to use those as roots, and maybe outside doesn’t need them anymore, but GC doesn’t know, so not clearing those up. Give outside world the callback information, and have the outside world notify that the info is not needed anymore, so it’s no longer a root. This will clean up simple cycles, and could be the main form of cycles.

FM: If you have an event listener in your DOM, which calls a wasm function, and that node is GC'd because it is cut out of the graph, there's no way of knowing that the wasm function isn't needed...

AK: this is why we added WeakRefs to JS, for this case. We knew that this was when there are no cycles through the linear memory.

RT: You're finding that it's not sufficient?

AK: we’re still beginning that journey, Chrome shipping that in M84, don’t yet know it is sufficient. Sufficient for use cases where it’s simple, application doesn’t have GC, just vending JS wrapper for objects. But in internal Chrome discussion, same thing that Keith mentioned came up, people who built unified heap asked if we won’t have the same problems that are analogous in the browser.

FM: The answer to that is yes, isn't it?

RT: high level question to consider is do we want to set it up such that applications have infra to say what weak refs are, and if you don’t do that, then there’ll be a memory leak. Or do we want to figure out how to do the more advanced ones, where GC interact with each other in some coordinated way, so you can GC through multiple spaces.

KM: With weakrefs… it wouldn't be performant, but can't you do all of this already, as an experiment?

RT: played with that, there are a lot of cases, you can get these spirals where… weakref to your thing, then ref to table, and that ref is what is keeping weakref alive

KM: You can have cycles, but you can experiment with applications using the handle mechanism. 

RT: roughly what i was describing

KM: It has a different collection timeline, which is only in the run loop. But we wouldn't do something different anyway. But it seems like someone could build an application with this form and see what happens. I think it's doable today.

RT: not performance considerations, but semantic. How do programs communicate these kind of information? Without having to run the program, you can tell which ones it will work for. Do we tell people that’s the only one we will support, so make sure programs work well with that. If you want something more advanced, use GC.

KM: I worry about telling people that too much. I expect people will use their own use case, and find that it works in one browser, but not in others, or not with a new browser GC, and we'll be trying to solve the compat problem there.

RT: all browsers will still have to perform the same way, application isn’t able to give the info browsers...

KM: I think in this case all browsers will probably leak and look bad here equally.

RT: need much more advanced, one of the two strategies, application give browsers info to do GC itself, or you have some sort of handshaking back and forth protocol, tried sketching, non-trivial, sharing information, might be do-able.

FM: This sounds like a MVP-type thing. We could start with weakref solution, and then let another generation solve the harder problem.

RT: have to figure out if it is separable enough, would it change how we design the GC proposal? Probably no?

FM: don’t foresee that the same tech, host gc and linear gc, I don’t think that’s a requirement. Two kinds of styles, someone wants to bring ocaml to the web and use their own GC. You can do that with these tools we provide. The other one is ditch your own GC and use the host. There may be overlap in the future but my guess is not significant. But… as a total offering, we will offer GC to language designers, you can use host provided GC, your data structures have to fit our pattern, or do you own GC, here’s some tools that might work for you. As a group we can say, hang on a min, linear memory is way more important than host gc, i’m suggesting that no we don’t, this is more a MVP. Should be Minimum Awesome Product. If people are ambivalent about supporting linear memory gc, then having a simple thing that doesn’t… integrating the timeline of GC strikes me as really hard to get right.

BS: we had a lot of discussion about how to deal with cycles. This has been on people’s mind for a while. Wondering if there are other requirements. This technical requirement is the biggest one, but are there other requirements we can imagine?

FM: channelling keith a bit… the other part of this would be… if you are a language with your own GC, how natural a fit would the already existing GC be over what we do. The better that is, the easier it would be to port languages onto Wasm -> more adoption. Having a solution that is simple and minimally invasive to the language will foster adoption.

BS: in the past this is what people have been describing as the benefit of linear memory gc, more closely fit existing models.

Sabine (chat): Side note: If popularity of languages is a criterion, then we should use better data than the TIOBE index. (If you are not aware what TIOBE index actually is, do a web search). Better data can be extracted from looking at active repositories on github (biased towards open source) or activity on stackoverflow (probably more representative overall).

BS: for linear memory gc, considering the popularity of language is important, and having a good metric is important too.

KM: idk if we want to commit to this. I don’t think it’s fundamentally that linear memory gc and host gc are incompatible. I can imagine where you can have both, how they interact idk, they are references you pass around, can extract as needed. Might be interesting to consider, where should we focus our efforts first? If we end up choosing one over the other, doesn’t mean the other will not happen, just where we are spending effort first to get to MAP to people first. Probably better to have one thing come up first, another come up later, rather than both later.

FM: Right, we have to choose.

RT: want to consider that, while designing one, should consider what you want to add later on, some forward compatibility work. For linear gc, however we design the host gc system, whatever we add for linear gc and host gc cooperation, probably will be independent of that design, no big forwards compat issue here.

BS: fortunately, there are existing languages compiling to Wasm using linear memory and implementing GC on the shadow stack, considering switching to host GC. We might see this naturally as the evolution, when language tries to do the transition and choose how they do the interop. E.g. Go does this, and Blazor does this.

RT: non-gc features that can help with that, such as stack inspection, such that you don’t have to maintain shadow stack, just look for roots on demand, often faster. But that’s separate from host gc.

FM: I do agree that we should try to focus… part of the reason for having this discussion at all, is that there is a fight for the soul of WebAssembly. Some people see that the relationship between and JS and wasm module, or the relationship between the host and the module being critical. And for them, having a unitary model of memory is a no-brainer. This shows up in some unexpected places, for example with exception handling there are entities shared between the host and the application. OTOH, the other side of this is the C++ code that "I want to run, so just give me the data, I know how to do GC, just get out of my way". There's a choice. If we pick one then we're going to alienate the other lot. I have an opinion. I think we should focus on host-provided GC. But I think we should honor the other side of the story too. My reasoning for opting for host-provided GC -- it's similar to the guest thing. The host knows its environment better than any language can. It's best able to tailor its GC for its environment. But with a general programming language, you don't know what the host GC is like, so you don't know what kind of GC to provide. But I do think we should choose. By the way, it wasn't my starting point, I first started on the other side.

RT: agree with your points, while we are on the topic… here’s an idea for how you can make host and linear gc collaborate. You can say, linear gc, if you want the host to help you with memory management, you need to abide by certain conventions: let me know your roots (addresses into arrays), when go to a gc allocated block, above it is some bits to indicate which are refs and scalars, can use that info to walk you map for your without running your code. This restricts how you do GC, but allows collaborating. More corner cases to consider. If you do linear gc with this convention, the host can incorporate that into the GC process. Is that appealing? Either to host or to the modules.

BS: i will guess that it doesn’t solve one problem we hope linear memory gc would be - would need to change gc. If host requires some layout, porting your language will need more invasive changes

WO (chat): ok, my mics not working, but I would contest that the host "knows better" how to do GC.. I would say the language knows best how to manage its own objects. Also, do keep in mind we are designing Wasm to also run without a browser, and without JS/Dom

FM: the host knows its environment better than the language does… there's more opportunity for contextualizing GC. An example in Java, there are different GCs for different applications. Some are suitable for terabyte memories, and some for laptops. But the JVM can choose for itself, you can tailor the GC to the application.

RT: I know that Wouter suggested that we don't share, and instead "I copy to you, and you copy back". One downside is large objects. And there's mutable objects. If we want to support that kind of thing, then we have to deal with fine-shared memory. If we don't want to do that, then there's a lot more freedom, since we don't have to deal with it. Do people prefer to have more clear boundaries?

BT: step back a bit, reqs for linear gc that comes from host gc. We use a couple of models here, where we assume host gc works in synchronous manner, nowadays gcs are becoming more concurrent. This being observable also means that it is difficult to make it concurrent. Memory management community is close to making concurrent gc the default in the future. If you allow any concurrent computation of Wasm on same memory, it will be chaos, race.

RT: Yeah, that would only work if the application was paused while that was happening.

BT: if you need to pause to do it, then performance suffers for the whole system. Whether that’s declarative or code you have to run, that’s something you can’t get around.

BS: primary concerns that Keith had, how to deal with safepoints and concurrent gc.

RT: rules that option out, it basically leaves you to weak refs, or you come up with coordination policy. You are responsible for collecting your memory, then some communication principle to declare dependencies.

BT: On this topic, I don't think concurrency rules this out. I think observability rules it out, at least on the web. Could work, but if you want this to work, it needs to be concurrent.

BS: few minutes left, any final points?

JK: another aspect to perf and efficiency, making me skeptical about the two-gc system. The cycles certainly can be solved on a functional level, can get arbitrarily complicated, cycles with pointers crossing boundaries many times. If you have one gc informing the other is alive, then the other gc has to run a full gc cycle. When it does a full cycle, it might only free up 1 ref, then it has to inform the other gc, which has another cycle to do. We have seen in chrome, you can have inefficient full gc cycles in two worlds without making progress in cleaning up progress. That’s what the unified heap is the answer for, making it efficient to find cycles, with the assumption that applications can be arbitrarily complex.

RT: yea it’s not easy to do this

BS: if there were some nice examples or writeups for this. It’s probably an interesting research problem and will help put some constraints on how we tackle this problem.
