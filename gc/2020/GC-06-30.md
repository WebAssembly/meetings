### Discussion: criteria/objectives/requirements for GC proposal

[Francis presenting slides]
[TODO: slides]

JS: Worth noting that there is a lot of interest in compiling JS to wasm, where they want to speed up their code. Also swift is reference counted and compiled through LLVM (pointed out by Wouter)

FM: Don't want to digress too much on JS

[back to slides]

RT: What does architectural integrity mean to you?

FM: Simple way -- if you have two concepts that could be separated, they should be separated. Converse of compositionality. There's much more to be said about it, but the reason for focusing on it is that if you have a well-structured design, it's easier to survive into the future.

[back to slides]

Zalim: How about binary size?

FM/KM: I would lump that in with performance.

[back to slides]

KM: when you say "source language", you mean the true source or the compiled wasm source?

FM: The true source. Changing C++ to add managed memory for example will make it no longer C++.

[back to slides]

RT: That's useful framing.

KM: I agree with a lot of what you're saying. Not sure about total ordering, but I agree with priority. I don't think we want to overly design with the way things are today...

RT: that’s the one thing i want to suggest in addition to what francis has. Tiobe index, we want those working. But this index reflects old languages, not the new upcoming languages. Since Wasm is going to be around for a long time, it is hard to predict what those upcoming languages are. We want to add some flexibility in plan, leave room for what upcoming languages might need.

KM: Fair.

FM: I do want to push back a bit on that. This is not an academic exercise. It's not a design of a perfect virtual machine. What we're trying to do is satisfy users. Yes, it's possible that some fantastic language will come along and blow everything away. But if you look at that index, it's been stable for 20 years.

RT: agree with your points. Looking at the index, i see C#, it is one of the more forefront language. If we get good support for it, we will get support for upcoming languages. Place emphasis on more modern features on younger features as indicative of upcoming trends. 

DW (in chat): How important is interoperability with JS in this scenario?

KM: Clarify what "this scenario" is…?

FM: that’s why I phrase it the way I did. I don’t view JS as being especially privileged. If you adopt the principle that you don’t try to support full hands-on interoperability between languages, but ou support shared resources between languages and modules, then that puts the relationship between Wasm and JS on the same footing as any other language. When we interop with JS, it’s as though it’s a foreign language. We are not trying to support direct access to JS inside Wasm, and conversely we don’t require modifications to JS. Ben Titzer had a proposal some time ago for statistically typed JS objects, you may want to do that, but it’s not for Wasm’s benefit.

KM: I think interop w/ JS is flexible. I do think it's important that we have good interop with host APIs. If you don't have good interop there, then there's a huge amount of code that… I think it would be a bad choice if we don't have good interop there. It's billions of lines of code.

FM: digging into this a bit more, what does it mean to have good interoperability

KM: For example, what the bridging cost is, for wasm to host APIs. If you have to copy all your data at the edge. You don't have to do that for JS, you just hand your objects over to the DOM and it works.

FM: In reality, it’s a bit more complex than that. This is front and center when we were looking at Interface Types, we had a similar starting point. But our experiments have shown us the other side of that, it’s not worth making undue effort for that.

RT: Maybe I can make a concrete suggestion: if you make a GC reference. If you want to support specialized JS interop, you can specify the JS class associated with it, when it goes to JS, it has the structure specified. Another one is: you make a object, then hand it to JS, then JS makes its own wrapper around it. But wasm isn't the one responsible for making that structure.

FM: I will go a bit further still. If I have a module that exports an entity, a shared entity, I am also responsible for exporting functions that access it.

KM: What do you mean by entity here?

FM: yes. Let’s take a DOM for example. A DOM node coming in from browser to Wasm will show up as an externref. I don’t view it as Wasm’s job to also support access to that DOM. If I want to access DOM, I use an API function. Conversely, if I am exporting from Wasm, something to be used in JS, Wasm is not responsible for making JS’s job easier. In particular, JS has bonkers semantics as far as accessing is concerned.

KM: Are we still talking about the same topic? I was saying that, as a criteria, for performance reasons, that we can copy into the DOM everytime. Calling a function is fine, but copying data can be expensive, so if we're going to go that way, we should have data that shows that it doesn't adversely affect, and what the performance difference is.

FM: yea. This isn’t really connected to GC, but it is difficult to run exhaustive experiments, but both Mozilla and Google have done some simple experiments in this area, for accessing DOm and graphics API and trying to optimize that. In the case of the DOM, one of hte most intensive thing is to walk over the DOM, no other computation. If you try and do this from Wasm rather than from JS. With some reasonable approaches, that don’t involve special privileges, then access from JS and access from Wasm basically the same. It’s done through APIs, not that the DOM has special access. Optimizing that doesn’t pay a lot of benefits.

LW: No, that wasn’t our result. 2 to 3x speedup from what Wasm could do before. Faster than JS, huge speedup. Then made something more realistic, VDOM, took an algorithm that did the diff, got 30% faster if it was wasm calling through JS. the diff computation was only a percentage of overall. With further work, the framework could be rewritten to be a fused diff+apply algorithm, and will get speedup. This is a meaningful result, say for WebGL workloads. Right now people avoid crossing Wasm dom boundary because it is slow. Chicken and egg problem. When you do heavy crossing, it can be significant, once it’s not, then people will do it more, and it will matter more. We cannot draw the conclusion that for all time it won’t matter.

RT: My sense is that this is related to conversation next week at CG meeting about intrinsics. There's a separate discussion about that.

LW: that won’t cover DOM access

BS: might want to refocus on the GC aspects than the Interface Type results

LW: afaict, the major relation between GC and web access is cyclist that goes in and out of host, Wasm gc allows those cycles to be collected

TT: I just wanted to mention: I think JS/wasm interop is a huge opportunity for wasm on the web. If you look at v8, then you have one object model. Wasm objects and JS objects are not that different, so it's technically feasible to add access in both directions. Given that JS on the web is so important, and we have legacy access to JS, it's crucially important that we have something smoother than just calling JS functions. I'm also currently working on a proposal to have JS access to wasm objects.

KM: agree, the incremental updating is very valuable. I don’t have any particular valuation on how much balance there should be, the more we can interop, we should do so. Not sure what the barrier where we decide is not worth it. Nonetheless there is a lot of value, especially for incremental adoption. Most large websites won’t be able to throw up an entire codebase with 7000 web devs and replace it with Wasm in a single day.

LW: The really hard problem is trying to bridge between JS objects/wasm objects. It's easier to have wasm objects flow out to JS… JS is so flexible so we should be able to map wasm objects into it. But it's a one-directional thing. It seems like it will be much harder to go the other way.

FM: completely agree

TT: if at least we have 1 of the two directions working, we have a huge gain. We can choose which side we want to do the fine-grained interop

KM: It also helps that JS is one language, and not infinitely many (effectively).

BS: another comment in the chat we should talk about, from Sabine

Sabine (chat): What about Python and Ruby, do we have any concrete interest from there to compile to WebAssembly and use the GC? These are fairly popular languages.

RT (chat): Those are both up in the TIOBE index, so presumably yes.

GK: haskell might not be as high, but since we are actively working on it, i expect there will be some support for it if possible, and more support for it. It is not java but has been around for just as long.

FM: Longer actually, haskell started in '92.

KM: hope that what both francis was proposing and the reality is that, we are not intentionally sabotaging languages not at the top of the index. We should do our best to work with as many languages as possible. What FM was talking about, those languages are important to support, because they have so many uses, we want to get them working well, so that when people migrate, then can reuse existing logic. We are not trying to be arbiters of what languages are popular in Wasm, but it is a reflection of reality of how we define success in terms of how the programming language world works today.

FM: Yes, that is what I was trying to get to. Ross has talked before about "code migration". What I'm saying is that we shouldn't require code migration, we shouldn't require people to rewrite their algorithms to use wasm.

RT: That wasn’t what code migration is about, but I agree that we shouldn’t require rewriting algorithms to work on Wasm

FM: It boils down to -- don't lose focus on your customer. They're the ones we're trying to support.

KM: One thing important to people well above me in my org, we shouldn’t have to rewrite source language to work with GC at all. On the web platform there are fundamental paradigms built in that are important, might have to change source to work well with DOM. Run loop is important for people on WebKit… If someone have to rewrite code to work with runloop...

RT: high level -- the web is not just a language, but an ecosystem, so you may need to rewrite some things…

KM: source changes need to be made to work with ecosystem, to work with webassembly gc it shouldn’t require source changes

LW: One of the benefits of the suspend/resume feature is that we could support that kind of functionality. I also want to point that there's "compiling wasm to GC" or embedding the wasm engine in the language. Bring python to the web, run in wasm … or bring wasm into python.

FM: want to pick up on something someone said, about compiling JS to wasm (JS raised this). It’s one of the first things I thought of when I joined this activity. Turns out that for historical reasons or whatever, probably not a very fruitful route at the moment. We already have very good JS  on the web, unlikely we will beat that.

KM: I think a better question is other dynamic languages, python or ruby. Where they're close enough… maybe not quite as intense as JS. But they have most of the same optimizations you can do, inline caching...

RT: for dynamic languages, two classes, dynamic with uniform memory model like JS and Python, maybe Ruby. Another is dynamic with lots of casing, lisp family. For GC, they behave differently, so it’s important to recognize those as separate classes.

FM: Why is lisp so different?

RT: lisp scheme racket, they are tons of primitive reference types that they case match on all the time, rather than assuming everything is an object, and always access things in a particular manner.

KM: Are those primitives implemented in the runtime as primitives?

RT: varies. Large cases, many different implementation strategies were explored. There are roughly uniformed dynamic languages, and many-case dynamic languages that behave differently. Lisp is fairly simple, but multiple lineages and variations.

KM: We've talked mostly about host GC here. Should we talk about linear memory GC criteria next time?

RT: one high-level concern, top 20 languages include C# and go and swift, you get a lot of features that you need. So a question we need to discuss is, what plan do we want to have for dealing with timeline pressures and feature richness. There is a tension between doing a fully- featured thin v.s. Getting something out.

FM: do it in order of popularity? That will put C# near the top.

RT: doesn’t help with the number of features you have to build

FM: by solving the GC problem, not necessarily enabling all these problems. It is a big thing, necessary but not sufficient.

KM: On swift, does it make sense for them to use the GC implementation anyway? They're reference counted, and they have value types.

LW: does it have destructors?

KM: yes

LW: hard to emulate precisely

KM: probably isn’t true given the code that i have seen. Can hope that stdlibs are written such that they don’t need to be precise when they are called. My guess is no, probably weird bugs if you run them (destructor) later

BS: not sure we want to talk about linear memory GC with some framing, 10 mins left, probably next meeting.

KM: yea agree

BS: any other comments on what Francis presented? To disagree or add to.

TT: one perspective, we talk a lot about languages, but we also should talk about optimization technologies, like JIT compilers, and how they fit into Wasm GC. most languages need optimizations. E.g. putting dynamic languages onto wasm, what does this mean? Interpreter, or JIT, then you have to build a VM. not clear where you put this VM. you can’t AOT compile dynamic languages in a reasonable way. Same question for Java, someone in the pipeline you have to do the optimizations, we need to decide where this happens.

KM: That's a good point. I know that, given that everyone here probably wors on a runtime, there's a bias toward total control. There are some downsides to that, like binary size if you have your JIT engine. I would err toward giving the host control of things (I'm biased though). The host has knowledge of what's going on in the system, they have sophisticated garbage collectors, they can JIT compile... so I hope that we might be relinquishing some control for the betterment of everyone else.

FM: a way of putting that is that the browser knows how to GC itself, tyvm. You’re right, the host has an environment, it has more context. You’re the host of the party, you get to set the rules. You can leave the party as a guest. Loading a wasm module in the browser, you are running in someone else's environment. Tobias’ question is not really directly connected to GC, more general at the Wasm value.

TT: Building a managed runtime, right. Similar to CLR or JVM. It's pretty open how we build this managed runtime, but we do have one.

FM: there are blockers to Java being adopted to Wasm. The GC is only one of those blockers. JIT is a major one for Java, classloaders another one. We are not solving all the problems for bringing Java onto Wasm, just solving some of them.

KM: I think JITting is something we should consider during the GC proposal. We shouldn't make it impossible. But I don't think we should be trying to solve this part of the proposal.

RT: 1 important consideration, for C#, the plan for it should rely on C# to have JIT… do we want to have the support that C# needs to not require JITting.

KM: Jitting in the wasm runtime or the C# runtime?

RT: two ways to implement C#, fancy polymorphism for dynamic monomorphism We are not going to support the former, then dynamic monomorphism. But if we don’t have an infra for JITting dynamic monomorphism...

FM: Point of clarity here -- you could mean generating wasm code, or you could mean generating native code.

RT: either would solve their problem, are we going to provide reasonable support for either one

FM: I don't think we've been talking about allowing wasm to generate native code. There is a requirement that is connected to this, related to GC. And that's garbage collecting code. That might be a requirement that we adopt. Not just data structures but also code.

LW: we already have the requirement, you can dynamically generate modules, you can leak them. Stack scanning, make sure don’t accidentally delete something live on the stack.

BS: out of time, looks like a good place to stop. There will be a meeting in two weeks, I will create an issue, please add agenda items to that issue.

FM: suggestion to focus on linear memory gc
