Presentation: High-level summary of research into low-level GCs (Ross Tate)

Ross presenting: Typed Assembly Languages [[pdf](presentations/2020-08-25-tate-typed-assembly-languages.pdf)] [[pptx](presentations/2020-08-25-tate-typed-assembly-languages.pptx)]

[pseudo-instructions: slide 16]

TL: Here the type variables are explicit in the language, (beta) is part of the syntax. For a stack machine like wasm, we don't have type variables, but we do have implicit types on the stack machine. How would unpack/pack instructions work on Wasm, and would we need explicit type variables?

RT: few ways to do this, if you were going to use pack/unpack explicit instructions, you will have type variables on stack that are not real variables, phantom that are erased at runtime, or locals, use let. Unpack can be let with destructure.

TL: in places where we currently have type annotations we'd have to reference those local type variables.

RT: lot of this work has block labels parameterized by types

JS: It's worth noting that there are solutions to this problem that Ross is going to talk about that don't require this.

RT: will get to that, thomas wants more evidence what this will entails

[slide 23]

TL: Validation is 50% relative to compilation time, but what does that include? Our compilation time is half of LLVM and v8… so what are they comparing to?

RT: don’t remember the details of the numbers, they say how long it takes to compile and valid. This is over 20 years ago, take that in mind when i give absolute numbers… for absolute, a MB file to validate takes 8 mins (this is a long time ago), don’t know what our times will be. We will talk about techniques that reduce both numbers substantially

[slide 28, point on “Bounded polymorphism is undecidable”]

AR: Certain versions of it are undecidable.

RT: yup

[back to slides]

[slide 35]

TL: Am I correct in observing that this is very similar to schemes from SOIL proposal?

RT: Disconnect is that schemes are able to be converted to this, but this is more expressive than schemes.

[back to slides]

FM: What's the takeaway for GC?

RT: 1st we have to have a discussion about existential types. If we just want to have dynamic methods, that's ok, we just need to have a discussion. If we want to do existential types, then we should incorporate the strategies from Juan Chen et. al. since they've found how to do this for other languages.

FM: Anything special about Java that wasn't covered by C#?

RT: some differences… in the call tags stuff, talked about interfaces, the way these two do interfaces are difference, java has single instantiation inheritance, C# has multiple, some optimizations you can do for Java that you cannot do for C#. C# 1.0 was pre generics, only for arrays, we got arrays working and sketched for other generics as well. These are three biggest differences, value types, reification, interfaces. For C# to be compatible with java, has covariant arrays. In Java, string array can be an obj array, then when you assign value (e.g. int) to object array, there is a runtime check, to ensure all string arrays only contain strings.

BT: Is there any work on applying TAL to late binding? Separately compiled modules?

RT: yes, golden age group has a paper on that topic. Can pull it up for your afterwards. Other papers too. Also has stuff on JIT-ing too.

BS: include those links to papers that will be great, put it in meeting notes

  * Links separately compiled TALx86 object files
  * Links are direct, i.e. no use of a run-time module-instance data structure
  * Linking is done statically, but hypothesized to scale to dynamic loading, though left unresolved due to there not being an obvious right choice for various policy considerations
