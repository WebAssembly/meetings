### Update: v8 GC prototype (@jakobkummerow)

RT: How are you doing v-tables?

JK: You can put function references into an array?

[some audio issues]

RT: Function calls have to be done by putting a funcref into a table, just wondering if that's the plan

JK: Yes, I think so. Not strictly required to have function references right now. If so, we'll add it.

Zalim: Any information about when it will be finished?

JK: I'm hoping in a week or so, but not willing to make

KM: Any further work?

JK: Not quite done with milestone 2, not sure what to do after that. Don't want to waste work. Not too willing to do experimental work. We're interested in hearing feedback. Planning to take time to respond to feedback.

HH: How best to try this out?

JK: Compiling from source is not too hard. You can use [JSVU](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsvu), you can get fairly up-to-date binary snapshots. Also can use Chrome canary (24-hour latency)

RT: Minimal features, surprised that let-locals are required. Interesting to hear why.

JK: We added those so we had a way to test non-nullable references. You could have as an intermediate on stack values.

### Update: Kotlin GC implementation (@skuzmich)

[Syvatoslav Presenting]
TODO(syvatoslav): slides

KM: Nullable references. Rough estimate, how many are trivially provable that the value is not null? On the wasm-side?

SK: I don't have that data.

KM: Just curious.

FM: You don't need VM support for coroutines?

SK: They are stackless coroutines, implemented in user-space.

FM: Ah, so you do program transformation for that. Would it help if there were VM support for it?

SK: Not sure.

RT: Yes, they are syntactically restricted like C#.

FM: There may be less code if there was a common pattern for coroutines.

RT: For non-nullable references: kotlin can guarantee that strings are non-null. When you defining strings, are you defining it as non-null?

SK: We have enough information about non-null references, but FF doesn't have this yet.

HH: For generics, I assume you add costs. Do you know what kind of performance improvements you could gain?

SK: Haven't measured performance yet, just functionality. Casting and v-tables are suboptimal. We're waiting for more VM functionality.

RT: Your generics are erased, right. So you have to cast them anyway to guarantee soundness.

HH: If you have enough information in the source language, you could prove it.

SK: I believe you can infer a lot of information from the language about generics. But yes currently they are unsound, and you have to add casts. We don't have immediate plans to investigate in this area.

### Discussion: Linear memory GCs (@kmiller68)

KM: We want to make sure that linear memory GCs have good integration with the host GC. We've spent a lot of time and bugs on integrating GCs. I think every engine has multiple GCs at this point. I hope we can come up with some way to avoid this. I was hoping to come up with some sort of criteria.

KM: So in linear memory GC, so the wasm module is providing its own collection strategy. So you are building a connection graph, which is also connected to host GC. This is similar to browser GCs where DOM and JS have connections between them. For us we have DOM reference counted and JS garbage collected. So we have issues here. I assume that a naive linear memory GCs will have similar issues. So we can expect that differences between browsers may cause issues here, causing memory leaks.

KM: I'd like to have a problem statement that can prove we can solve it.

RT: It's a pretty hard problem. I've discussed this with Steve Blackburn.

[general agreement from browser VMs that this is very hard]

JK: Our teams have determined that the only permanent solution is to combine them.

RT: You need a way to have a finalizer in and out. The problematic cases is when you have spirals coming in and out between GCs.

KM: There's also issues with reference counted implementations, since they have cycle detection algorithms. A lot of GCs are concurrent too, and you need to interact with their safepoints.

HH: Can you use message passing to do this… like Erlang? Would that work?

KM: I suppose that could work.

FM: One of the memes coming out of interface types is that you make this available at the edge. You have a map at the outside that allows the two worlds to talk to each other. One possible idea is that you don't try to have a close integration with the host. You delegate everything to the API at the edges.

KM: That's still kind of how it works on the web. You're more likely to have leaks then, you have to call a function to retain. The bridge will have a hard root because they need to be in a table somewhere.

WVO: I guess you would not try to use references across the boundary. So both spaces would not have references.

KM: It sounds like a lot of copying --

FM: It might not be, though. At least with DOM walking, it turns out that it has not very measurable overhead. In practice, this may be a better strategy than you think it would.

RH: At least for the DOM, there are cases where you can't just copy. For example, addEventListener with a callback needs a reference. If you want to do this in Interface Types, you need references across the boundary.

FM: The event loop cycle is the obvious and serious one. The approach we've been considering here is that you model that DOM reference as a resource. And someone has to take responsibility for managing the lifetime of that resource. You don't rely on GC for that, instead they have to be explicit.

KM: So you reference count.

FM: We're not, the application does.

KM: That's the case we're worrying about, we rely on the DOM to be careful. And that has problems, people make mistakes.

FM: The difference is that the module has their own language, and their own GC story. The application takes responsibility for managing its resources. If there is a mistake there…

KM: That would be fine if I didn't get bug reports if a website didn't work in my implementation.

LW: Two application scenarios: blackbox model (like Francis is talking about). The other one is taking languages like scala.js kotlin.js, with tight integration with JS. Trying to make it feel like you're using typed JS. For those languages, you need a host-integrated GC.

KM: I think it would be a shame if it would be better if compiling to JS was better than our GC story. It would be an unfortunate conclusion if it ended up that way.

LW: OK, for the scope of the wasm GC proposal it seems like host-integrated is what we're talking about. And separate discussion for the other model.

HH: Talking about implementation -- I don't see how that matters. As for semantics, I don't see how the implementation matters.

LW: There's a fear that the different browser GC implementations will cause differences in behavior.

KM: And the browser rewrite the GCs too.

RT: One strategy we came up with -- you can use a coloring GC scheme. You reserve additional space for flags. If you design for only having one flag, that rules out other strategies.

FM: There's a difference between works-as-intended, and works on my page.

RT: Running low on time, should we switch topics?

### Discussion: criteria/objectives/requirements for GC proposal (@fgmccabe)

[Francis presenting slides]
TODO: slides and discussion about critical factors analysis

KM: So idea here is that we have a list of criteria, in readme.

FM: You could use a diagram, yes. It makes the relationships more readable.

JS: Good idea. Best way to do this is for someone to make a strawperson, to have a concrete starting point.

AI(binji): add agenda item to discuss criteria at next meeting
