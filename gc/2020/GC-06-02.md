## Meeting Notes

### Introduction of attendees

Ben Smith, Google

Cheng Shao, Tweag.io Haskell, interested weak refs

Jakob Kummerow, Google

Francis McCabe, Google

Syvatoslav Kuzmich, Jet Brains

Zhi An Ng, Google

Daniel Wirtz, AssemblyScript

Sabine Schmaltz, Tarides, interested in dynamic memory model of OCaml in wasm

Ross Tate, Cornell University, interested in wasm for wide variety of languages, balance short term + long term needs

Ben Titzer, Australian National University, interested in next generation of languages

Ryan Hunt, Mozilla, stay up to date, provide implementation feedback, help find consensus

Gergely Buday, Eszterházy Károly University Hungary

Keith Miller, Apple,  Been attending a bunch of WASM meetings for WebKit, want to see GC move forward since it’s the biggest missing feature of WASM, in my opinion.

Andreas Rossberg, Dfinity, previously Google on V8, champion of GC proposal as it stands, want to move the proposal forward now that some prerequisites are met

Luke Wagner, Mozilla, implemented in SpiderMonkey earlier, excited to see others interested

Deepti, Google, follow along, stay up to date

JP Sugarbroad, Android/Google, integrating Wasm

Adam Klein, Google, excited about seeing languages beyond C++/C/Rust target the web

Emanuel Zigler, Google WebAssembly Runtime Team (together with Jakob), bring additional languages to the web, interaction between JS and Wasm GC

Hans Hoeglund, Tweag.io, high level language support in Wasm

George Karachalias, Tweag.io, Austelius, Haskell -> Wasm compiler, stay up to date

Thomas Lively, WebAssembly Tools team at Google, curious observer, active in other proposals

Wouter Van Oortmerssen, WebAssembly Tools team at Google, see Wasm be the most awesome target for modern languages

### Agenda

(Andreas Rossberg presenting) TODO: add slides

JS: What is the driving reason for structural types into MVP?

AR: idea was, want complete type information, want to avoid need for run time checks. For MVP you could not care, but this is fundamental to the design, you want to resolve it from the beginning. Want to have zero-overhead to structs and arrays. Haven’t looked too closely at what you proposed, but probably don’t have that.

JS: No, it would be a runtime type-check.

AR: related to performance, more in space in locality, composability… People proposed simpler models with a vector of refs and binary data (split everything into two worlds), when you compile something that mixes stuff, then you’ll need to transpose with every access, destroying locality. Gets worse when you nest more levels. So you want something that you can nest things without destroying locality.

BT: You don't think function subtyping is a full issue yet … doesn't that depend on type imports?

AR: it’s not “not an issue”, not a particularly interesting issue. Subtyping on functions become interesting only once you have struct types. Before that, every subtyping you might want to have isn’t interesting in the higher order case. You can defer all function subtyping until this proposal. For imports. Not sure… For type imports, it doesn’t make a diff, unless we already allow it. 

BT: How complicated do you allow the bounds to be… if type imports are bounded by other type imports, then you have subtyping… if you are embedding objects from another language, then function subtyping leaks into subtyping.

AR: yes. But you already assume that you have some other subtyping. If there’s nothing other than function subtyping, you can’t do anything interesting.


BT: In the limit, type imports will allow you to define subtypes...

AR: but there is no interesting way to use that, unless you have some other basic subtyping axioms

BS: we have a few other items...

AR: not entirely clear where this (function subtyping) belongs

BS: Ross can present next

Ross: I worked with a bunch of researchers on a different proposals, don't want to talk about differences, but want to show the context that led us to a different design

(Ross presenting slides: [Overview of SOIL Initiative’s GC Proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/gc/2020/presentations/2020-04-21-tate-soil-gc-overview.pptx))

KM: Ideas for post-MVP? Or during MVP?

RT: In my intro, mentioned about doing both short and long term. Trying to figure out a short term thing that is useful, and have a nice path for long term. So need to flesh out ideas (refer to ideas being explored slide) to allow a path for refinement. Not everything should go into MVP, it’s a lot. Acyclicity might be good, sounds like a lot of interest.

BS: Wouter, you were going to talk about linear memory GC? Do you have enough time?

WVO: didn’t make slides, made a summary on an issue, will share that on screen.

(WVO presents issue) TODO: add link to issue

CS: does the current type system for gc proposal support adding boxed/unboxed content, in haskell runtime we have a lot of places we would like a heap obj to contain references to .. also need them to contain machine words, current proposal, with struct types, it’s fine, if array, all the types have to be uniform. If i would like heap object to have runtime-defined length, i need an array, but means elements will be uniformed, it cannot contain both boxed and unboxed.

BS: Probably best to follow up on the issue tracker for this, since we're over time
