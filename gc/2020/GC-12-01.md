### Presentation: Type checking with multiple upper bounds (Ross Tate)

Slides for Exponential Non-Determinism: [(pdf)](presentations/2020-12-01-tate-exponential-nondeterminism.pdf) [(pptx)](2020-12-01-tate-exponential-nondeterminism.pptx)

<RT presenting>

AR: Clarification: The current MVP is not NP-hard. This is assuming some additions to the MVP.

CW: Specifically the addition is multiple upper bounds BT needed, which we probably can’t have as a result of this.

RT: Maybe. Conclusions will come later. It’s important that we are able to recognize these np-hard patterns when they come up because they are common.

TL: So essentially each vertex could be either red, green, or blue

RT: Yes.

JP: I see, there’s no principle type for struct.get because the first field is never named.

<back to slides>

TL: non-determinism in this case means there are choices to make, not necessarily that the search algorithm is non-deterministic.

RT: Right.

TL: Does that mean you always need a principle type so there are no choices?

RT: That’s one solution, but it has its own drawbacks.

FM: Is the `pick` important? Would this work with `rotate`?
RT: <describes a similar setup using rotate> It seems that having non-linear types is important, but WebAssembly will certainly have many non-linear types.

Slides for Determinizing Fields: [(pdf)](presentations/2020-12-01-tate-determinizing-fields.pdf) [(pptx)](2020-12-01-tate-determinizing-fields.pptx)

RT: Some systems specify a particular typing algorithm, but I’m assuming we want to specify declarative typing rules instead.

JP: Shouldn’t one of these types be a union?

RT: No, this depends on some type sensitivity in the Ceylon semantics that I won’t bother elaborating on here. There is a more general version that uses unions…. <finds possible mistake on slide and fixes it, making claim slightly weaker>.

<back to slides>

CW: Without intersection types, if you have multiple bounds… What is the expressivity gap between intersection types and just having multiple bounds without intersection types?

RT: When you construct the generating automaton, it changes what kind of types you could generate.

CW: So there is something that intersection types could express that you couldn’t express with multiple subtype bounds.

LW: With intersection types, the various bounds can be completely unrelated. Otherwise they would have to be compatible.

AR: I wonder how Steven Goldman’s work is related? In practice, you can often calculate the type. Various cases don’t come up.

RT: Looking at the practice of type systems is useful because it can tell you how to patch the system to remove bad algorithmics. Second issue is that at present I don’t know of any system that can fix this for low-level structural typing. I believe the work you’re referring to is for surface-level structural types, which look very different. Two questions: 1) is there a way to patch the system to make it efficiently decidable, 2) is that restriction practical. Right now we’re depending on our intuition for (2).

FM: Is ITalX is the dominant type the same as the polarity AR was talking about?

RT: No, it’s because there is a concrete class hierarchy tree.

<back to slides>

CW: Let’s imagine that as a result of these issues, we don’t add support for multiple upper bounds for many years. What would we lose as a result? For the post-MVP we’ll have lots of opportunities to think about different options and interactions.

RT: Well you wouldn’t be able to do BT’s Jawa system.

AR: There are also other things we would need to add to make Jawa work anyway. One early question we had was whether WebAssembly should have subsumption. Making upcasts explicit might help.

RT: Multiple upper bounds would make the MVP’s subtype relation PSPACE-hard. You couldn’t solve the problem with explicit subsumption (i.e. explicit upcasting) because subsumption itself would be PSPACE-hard.

AR: Not sure I understand how that could be the case. If we put in an upcast instruction....

RT: Even answering the question of whether two types are in a subtype relation would be PSPACE-hard, so type checking the upcast would be PSPACE-hard.

JP: You could have casts only do one step, so to go up multiple steps you need to chain them, so the checker doesn’t have to do a search.

AR: I’m not sure we need multiple structural upper bounds in the first place. Enforcing that some bounds are abstract would prevent merging modules, which is no good. Perhaps tracking which types are nominal or structural and ensuring that only nominal types are used as upper bounds or something like that would work.

RT: For user-level casts, you often introduce new structural upper bounds.

CW: That’s very hypothetical since we aren’t doing user-level types.

RT: The most conservative thing would be to allow bounds to be categorized into funcref, dataref, etc. but without any more interesting structure.

FM: Ross said at the beginning that we shouldn’t rely on an algorithm. In related field description logic, simple logics are decidable but also not very useful. Various attempts to increase expressiveness have all resulted in non-decidability, so the field accepts that.

AR: For Wasm you want to be deterministic in the programs you allow.

FM: That’s why you would specify the algorithm.

AR: There is a spectrum between nice systems and ad hoc algorithms. Advantage of staying declarative is that proofs and composition properties are easier. Also provides a clearer picture of interactions with various extensions. May be hard to extend algorithms with new features without breaking existing programs.

RT: Can make program transformations in tooling very sensitive to whether they break the algorithm, even if they’re otherwise obviously correct.

AR: Algorithmic semantics can be seductive.

FM: The logicians have a dual semantics as well. So the declarative semantics wouldn’t be thrown out. I mildly suggest we consider having an incomplete system that rejects some correct programs.

AR: Unclear how that would work out in practice.

RT: We should probably have a WebAssembly-wide discussion about whether we want our type system to be decidable and then whether we want it to be polynomial. It would be good to get consensus on that and add it to the requirements.
