### Discussion: Isorecursive types recap [Thomas Lively]

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EhVku1kSN1CzPoZ1QpN9SjHLtd6dAelTLFjeqwwetFI/edit?usp=sharing) 

RT: string is a subtype of object and mutually exclusive with object also cannot be expressed with iso

TL: like this pattern? (on slide titled Isorecursive types recap)

RT: this pattern is 2 mutually recursive extending non recursive, that is 2 mutually recursive, one extending another. String/Object is a concrete real world case

TL: forcing producers to detect this and emit the required checks seems like a lot of work. I’ve not been putting too much time into prototyping isorecursive types, doing more on equirecurisve and nominal.

AR: we keep bumping into this argument that… want to compile Java, but this cannot express Java, so we need casts. We will need casts in many instances, mutual recursion between classes is just one of those. Sure, equirecusrive ones are more convenient in that sense, part of the discussion is how this is related to separate compilation, where you can’t have mutual recursion easily. Overall, just because something requires casts, that is not sufficient reason to dismiss something. There are many things that require casts, and always will be. This isn’t a problem per-se, but how difficult it is to deal with this problem. Covering this case is not very hard, how to deal with them is harder.

RT: typed assembly language for C# that can support this

AR: specifically for OO language, not the same design goals that we have

TL: considering this isorecursive type system, we haven’t discussed how to find all possible cases that won’t work, and insert casts to make them work. I don’t have a great idea of the difficulties and edge cases. We can discuss that offline, try to work it out. Right now, my feeling is that it will be significant work, not clear on details. Agree with AR that casts are necessary for some languages

AR: every language, for some situations

TL: AR, is your feeling that this is a simple problem to solve?

AR: don’t know. From first glance, covering these cases is straightforward, when you have a forward reference. Less clear in separate compilation case. Any type can occur in forward place, go to top type / anyref. Less clear what to do when it occurs inside an Array, where you can’t subsume, as subtyping doesn’t apply there. Suspect that will induce casting obligations propagating to all sorts of places, maybe even impossible in some places. OTOH, suspect will be the same for many places in our type system. We only looked at Java and C#, the question of how much effort we make to tweak the type system to fit Java, is a good question. Do we want to do a JVM or a generic thing. We have to live with these problems and solve these problems, always a problem we will bump into.

TL: we have two teams working on prototype compilers, J2CL for Java and Dart for dart2wasm. Both are Java-like. It’s not just Java, we have Dart, but unless we have other groups prototyping stuff, these are the implementer feedback we have. We do have to listen to our implementer feedback.

AR: don’t disagree.

TL: if others want to pursue more isorecursive, figure out where casts are required, then we can go to J2CL team and tell them how to solve these problems.

RT: AR mentioned that in practice, researches found isorecursive sufficient for describing real functional languages.

AR: very technical and only about edge cases that in practice don’t matter much, when you need the compilation scheme then you run into them. It’s more ML specific, where you have a powerful module system, and depends on type abstraction, especially mutual recursive types. When you can abstract parts of a group in a group of mutually recursive types, then you are outside of what you can express in isorecursive. Isorecursive is monolithic thing, with equirecusrive you can take small pieces. E.g. type T in a module, and type U == something referring to T. You cannot match that with something where T is also mentioning U when you have isorecursive interpretation. That’s something you can do in ML/SML and think in OCaml too.

RT: allows unnamed fixpoint types? Like a type alias thats a fixed point?

AR: allows fixpoint across modules… allows to abstract over something that you don’t know yet is a fixpoint

RT: those are different

AR: you cannot abstract over groups of types before knowing they are recursive. You can still technically write it, they bumped into that in first formalization of standard ml and isorecursive types.

RT: useful to see that example

AR: remember that i wrote it up somewhere, thought had already, maybe not.

### Discussion: Nominal types across module boundaries [Thomas Lively]

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EhVku1kSN1CzPoZ1QpN9SjHLtd6dAelTLFjeqwwetFI/edit?usp=sharing) 

AR: example of mutually recursive modules, not sure why it’s worth discussing this? This is something we simply don’t have in Wasm. Even if you can find some ways in which you can compile this, there is no generally good way to deal with things like that, except casts at the type level, and references to tie the recursive knots. Can’t natively express that in Wasm. Headline there is that this example is specific to mutually recursive modules. Forgot where it came up exactly, think it was discussion on separate compilation of mutually recursive modules.

RT: trying to figure out why you claim only equi types can do recursive modules.

AR: a tangential remark on one of my presentation. My take is, this is not something we support

TL: at Wasm level we don’t want to support this, but we do want to be able to compile languages that support this into Wasm. Need to compile this source level module.

AR: answer to that will be language specific, with Haskell, recursive modules aren’t very well thought out, totally implementation dependent how you compile them. GHC allows separate compilation, if you write a signature file manually, kind of abusing the system. More working by accident. Java is completely different, there the linking of modules is very dynamic. Semantics is very dynamic, falls back to dynamic checks as far as semantics is concerned.

TL: all of the objection to using nominal types, come from this kind of situation, that’s my understanding.

AR: they come from linking, not necessarily mutual recursion

TL: this is a particularly interesting case of linking

RT: context was, you claim that we need equi types to support linking with mutual recursion, TL make a new thread asking for example, you gave this example

AR: examples don’t work unless we have equi linking, but i don’t consider it a goal to support this

CW: to be clear, this is about supporting examples like this at the Wasm system. What is needed to compile a whole [source] program with type definitions like this? Is it a goal to allow the definitions to be split into separate modules at the Wasm level and linked? Quite happy to say that this is a non goal. But then what is the goal? What are we expecting to do when you compile this program? I think it is acceptable to say there is a central module where all the types go.

AR: acceptable to say if you have mutually recursive modules, you need to compile into single module, which is what some modules are doing

TL: if we do that, and acceptable, nominal types will just work

AR: no, that discussion is not dependent on nominal types

CW: will remove mutual recursion as objection to nominal types

TL: weak import export, refactoring of modules, for these solutions, you need to know transitive dependencies to break cycles at build types, if we say all mutually recursive modules need to be compiled into same module, then becomes non-issue.

AR: we need to distinguish the general problem of type imports or structural types, and the problem of mutually recursive modules, they are separate problems to solve. The esoteric problem of mutually recursive modules is something we can impose limitations. In general, being able to link DAG-shaped dependency graphs in a reasonable fashion is something we want to support.

TL: let’s take an AI to hash out goals around dynamic linking of modules. It has come up in issues that we cannot use nominal types to support these kind of examples. If we don’t care about these examples, it has a big impact on nominal type discussions.

AR: nominal types is about linking, not at all specific for linking

RT: but when we have those discussion, this problem is brought up to object nominal types

AR: will give a presentation to explain the crucial points and why neither of the proposed solutions are solutions

TL: will be great to hear those points. Will help to be crisp about what we are trying to achieve, the requirements. These examples come directly from conversations where you were arguing that nominal types don’t work. Surprised to hear you say these examples don’t matter.

AR: yea there were many discussions, many confusions, and conflating various things. One of the big problem with the discussion we have, not focused, very tangential, not relevant to problems we are trying to solve.

CW: One way to pare down is to fix a principle saying, we do not care about supporting separate compilation of mutually recursive type declarations. Then we can focus on what you consider to be more realistic objections of nominal types.

AR: yea I can subscribe to those kind of statements.

TL: Let's try to hammer out those principles by our next meeting, then we can be ready with a shared understanding of our goals.

### Discussion: Deferred loading of types [Ross Tate]

Slides: Deferred Loading of Types [(pdf)](presentations/2021-06-29-tate-deferred-loading-of-types.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-06-29-tate-deferred-loading-of-types.pptx)

RT: do we want to support deferred loading, if we do , how do we want to support it? J2CL is fine with whole program compilation, but wants to support loading deferred parts of loading.

FM: You have to say who “we” means. Absolutely there are people who will take full advantage of deferred load modules.

[SLIDES]

AR: When do we want to support it? Eventually we want to support this, but I don’t see us making this a goal for the MVP

TL: for non-gc, we already support this, and in production for some emscripten users

AR: Let's say to some extent, I'm proposing to support this, part of structural type stories. My compiles have a repl that can do that, and depends on structural types. To that degree I agree. If something more sophisticated, then post-mvp.

CW: A useful question for now is, what potential hazards do we see in current designs that can affect having deferred loading as post-mvp.

LW: also things make sense to support this in MVP GC, can dynamically create modules, have all the building blocks using JS as glue, will be weird not to support this.

TL: even in MVP GC?

LW: Yes, the only thing added is a new type of memory.

AR: agree with that. Maybe I was expecting something different here. What you’re describing here is what I call incremental linking. Where you load types of your programs one after another. How sophisticated is that support. Maybe we should let RT continue to see what he has in mind. It can be solved today with some indirections.

[back to slides]

CW: are you imagining it will be important to do this at the granularity of per module, or per declaration of type, or bit of data.

RT: Java has specific semantics for how loading works. We could support that policy, I was more thinking of, someone wrote a program, then state that X classes will load now, Y classes load later, Z classes load even later. Then they will be in different modules.

CW: TL’s talk about deferred loading currently, what granularity is that?

TL: we start with a monolithic module, then profile, then split into 2 modules introducing all the indirections. From application POV, secondary module gets loading lazily and completely transparently, Wasm module is not aware anything is loaded, handled by Emscripten runtime.

CW: if you call a function that’s in the secondary module, you block until everything is loaded?

TL: yes

[back to slides]

LW: if Foo contained a call to Bar, what will the desired outcome be?

RT: depend on loading policy, the idea is what TL described, if you call that method before Bar is loaded, you have to wait. Don’t have to be ingrained into Wasm, but that’s how I imagine this example will work.

AR: here’s where i see the line for MVP, incremental loading is fine and easy to support, as long as it is bottom up, what RT is proposing here is you can load a module before you load some of its dependencies, much harder to support, and i would argue outside MVP. was wondering what Luke just asked, this example looks very artificial. In practice you call some methods of Bar, you’ll need to know the vtable, you are in the problem space....

RT: small example needs to be handled before we look at the bigger ones

BT: just tip of iceberg, just a mechanism to declare these types, ultimately this has to be implemented in type checking algorithm, what do you do when you get to a type that is not defined yet, you will need to type check them.

RT: if you are treating that abstractly, you can treat it without knowing its type

BT: type checking will run into something that won’t be defined. You have to define what it means when two types, one reference something not defined yet.

RT: a type that is only declared and not defined, it will say cannot compile

BT: type imports can import something that isn’t defined. Module foo has type import, bound to something not defined.

RT: this code works whether Bar is defined or not

CW: that module will only allowed to import the type completely abstractly

BT: you’re going to need to have type constraints, and multiple type constraints to compile Java

RT: just the tip of the iceberg right now yes

CW: in TL’s world, you have the escape valve, when a module is split, you can get all the internals. Here you only can split a module and defer loading if you can identify a boundary where the module deals with types abstractly. How common do you expect this to be? Do you see future features where you can do more with partially loaded types?

RT: more complex examples we can solve with staging, this portion of the module will only be defined at a later stage, and you need to give these imports. If you statically link everything, you get all the stages right away. If you defer some things later on, the later stages will only be accessible later only, your dynamic loader system will be responsible to put into stubs.

BT: if we imagine module Foo type Bar here, add a type constraint to Bar, instantiate foo with something not defined. You have a constraint, by instantiating foo with an incomplete type, you applied its import constraint to this type, when define it, whatever definition you have matches all the constraints of all instantiations you have already done.

AR: that is fine, it will be subtyping, you can’t supply something with stronger constraint. Real problem is how you deal with these constraints, how do you compile code. That can only be done efficiently with staged compilations. It goes to hypothetical extensions with staged compilations. We keep having these discussions without these features. Maybe we should start from there features before going on tangents.

BT: agree totally that this requires staged compilations. For Jawa, we have complete control over the VM. I introduced staging. Things become mutually recursive, they get tanged between modules too.

LW(chat): We’re over time but just one parting thought: if we’re focusing on the Emscripten dynamic-splitting-as-a-transparent-optimization use case, we have the simplifying context that you start with a monolithic module where you know everything, thus $__glue can actually define $Foo and $Bar fully with full structural information, so we’re in the easy case where nominal-vs-structural doesn’t really come up
