### Discussion: Equirecursive Types in Binaryen [Thomas Lively]

[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHXGNSkm7gCF5UcntnR_w9LlV2ANVpgSoiECTQzLIso/edit?usp=sharing)

TL: <recap of shape and global canonicalization>. LW and AR independently shared a paper for improving this by working incrementally, one strongly connected component at a time.

Action item: tlively to figure out how big / what the source for the mystery test module is.

Action item: Aske to look at Dart2Wasm type graphs for larger Dart programs, create a new issue.

… Discussion missing ...


AR: Will try to present isorecursive types next time. Implemented a new compiler, realized that currying currently requires many casts.

RT: Sabine and I looked at this and found that the call tags proposal has a way to solve this. No casting required in our solution.

CW: Is there something we can look at for how isorecursive folds and unfolds are hidden away?

AR: Formalizations of ML.

FP: Andreas, are you saying that isorecursive types won’t help with languages besides lambda calculus, or are you just saying they don’t show up.

AR: They are low-level types, not typically human-written.

FP: Would Java still be able to lower to them?

AR: The code generator would have to make the recursion groups explicit, so the code generator does some analysis. Will get linear type canonicalization.

RT: Why not use rtt.fresh rather than rtt.canon and avoid the need for type canonicalization entirely?

AR: Comes back to separate compilation.

BT: The separate compilation problem is constantly beset by problems for specific languages.

TL: Only concrete plans for separate compilation I’ve discussed use wasm-ld and C/C++-style object files and relocations rather than the richer native loading/linking semantics. We should design for what tools are actually going to use, not just be maximally flexible as a basic principle if there is going to be a performance cost to that.

AR: I have separate compilation working for the compilers I’ve been working on.

RT: Does it support separate compilation without recompiling dependent units?

AR: No, dependent units need to be recompiled, C++-style.

Two different notions of separate compilation, either the dependent modules also need to be recompiled or not.

RT: Standard techniques for very separate compilation that do not require jitting, e.g. import size of superclass, etc.

BT: Jawa work does require some jitting, but not much.
