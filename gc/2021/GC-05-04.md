### Discussion: Canonicalization

[slides](presentations/2021-05-04-rossberg-canonicalization.pdf)

RT: Are you ruling out the cross-module type recursion necessary for Java class files? In this case you have mutually recursive types that form new SCCs rather than unfolding to existing SCCs.

AR: No, that would require cyclic linking, which I don’t think we’re going to add.

TL: For warm cache measurements, you wouldn’t expect any runs after the first to be different because all the types are already in the cache.

CW: Time doesn’t look great <missed details>

RT: Cold cache time directly affects page loading time.

AR: Hard to tell what conclusions to draw from this.

RT: Our examples have been small, so 10x the number of types may be reasonable.

AR: Hard to say because J2CL example already includes some JDK, which tends to transitively include much more JDK.

BT: For reference, entire JDK contains over 100k classes.

AR: Yes, but there’s probably some base set that always gets included and most don’t.

FM: Did you plug in Hopcroft’s algorithm to compare?

AR: No, it’s unclear why you would do that. Both algorithms are fairly simple.

TL: Would be interested to figure out how much speedup is due to choice of algorithm and how much due to SCC at a time.

BT: Would it be easy to output the graphs in some format and run standard tools to minimize the graphs and see how it compares to optimized implementations?

AR: Would be easy, but I don’t know of any standard formats or tools.

BT: Could use parser generators like JavaCC. Come up with a grammar that encodes the graph.

AR: Probably easier to compare algorithms directly.

RT: This is only for rtt.canon and the current call indirect formulation. I have a proposal for a version of call indirect that doesn’t need it. We should also step back and consider whether all this work is worth it.

AR: More data would be the most useful thing right now.
