### Discussion: Nominal and structural types (2 hours)

AR presenting [slides](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/gc/2021/presentations/2021-07-13+-rossberg-modulariy.pdf)

AR: Recap from last time: there are many degrees of modularity that are important for different use cases and all are possible to use in Wasm today. Anything that works in a modular fashion today should still work with GC. Structural types are not a fringe problem. Many languages have structural types and they must be compiled correctly and handled at module boundaries.

Structural types are infinite in number, so declaring them in a runtime module does not scale.

CW: I appreciate the number of possible tuple types is infinite. You’re still matching each tuple type in the source code to a different struct definition. Same number of definitions in nominal and structural.

AR: Right. This is about the runtime module not scaling.

RT: You would have a loader that would deduplicate these types.

AR: Will get to that.

RT: How do you allocate a new struct for this?

AR: Just allocate a struct.

RT: In what OO language does a tuple not have a vtable?

AR: Good question. Not sure.

BT: This seems like a distraction. It’s easy to come up with a language with tuples with no vtables.

RT: Languages that do have tuples with vtables also need a mechanism to consolidate their vtables. If we have structural types, we can’t service such languages.

AR: You can synthesize the vtable, accessors, etc. on the fly.

RT: Java does ….

AR: This is why you wouldn’t want vtables.

RT: But C# does this as well.

BT: I’d like to see what AR has to say about Wob. There are lots of languages and implementation strategies.

RT: These strategies are appealing because they don’t solve the hard problems in real languages.

CW: “ought to be zero-overhead” line: We have an idea that certain vtable accesses should be zero-overhead from the source point of view, but in fact in Wasm there will be cost. Is this that kind of “ought” or actually zero overhead?

AR: This means actually zero-cost.

CW: You could imagine the Wasm types system not being rich enough to do this without casts.

AR: In functional languages this module access is about as common as method access in OO languages, so we want it to be fast.

RT: Why do nominal types break this diamond import example?

CW: I think it would be inaccurate to say “this works because of structural types” because we haven’t seen that it doesn’t work with nominal types yet. The top level coordination logic in equirecursive types is IMO the engine doing canonicalization.

RT: Right, you could instead have the loader do that coordination instead.

AR: Will get to those solutions in a bit.

CW: Again, that needs to come with caveats. There are patterns you can do with linear memory and static offsets that you cannot do with references. So it is too strong to say that everything you can do with linear memory you can do with references.

AR: Don’t remember your specific example.

CW: Could have modules import the same memory with offsets to coordinate.

BT: Could also do all sorts of other things like multi-dimensional inheritance in linear memory that we definitely can’t do with nominal types, so I’m not sure this is relevant.

FM: IMO, int32 is a nominal type, and it just happens to be known by everyone. The reason that it works is because everybody understands what int32 means

AR: yea, primitive types you can view as builtin nominal types, or structural types that are atomic. Since they are ambient, doesn’t matter which view you take

FM: you can solve ambient problem separately, you can have duplicate type definitions that you check for consistency, similar to checking structural type

AR: how is it not a structural type?

FM: because it has a name

CW: sounds to me like nominal types but with a linker in userspace that enforces structural convention for how types get passed, has some links to my notion to canonicalization in the engine

FM: if the argument is that you can’t do everything with structural types and nominal types, there is an obvious outcome - have both.

AR: fair argument, not sure if int32 is a good argument. You can view everything as a builtin type. You have to make some minimal set of primitives, otherwise nothing to boot from.

FM: disagree, you can boot from a bitstream

AR: the type language has to have something, otherwise you can’t build anything

TL: we should continue and see more examples, and come back to this more general discussion afterwards

CW: To be more specific about (2) (on structural import inversion slide), I would accept if the module carried some sort of state that had to be fed to the central infrastructure before that module could be linked in.

AR: yup, that’s fine, you’ll need some kind of reflection mechanism anyway, how that works specifically is not of concern

TL: example of treating indefinite as definite is wasi namespace or emscripten namespace

AR: also like es6 module, runtime resolves module based on path

TL: Emscripten has both, builtin and WASI modules, the user can then add whatever they want on top of that.

CW: is this necessarily true, having it is useful, but also can have toolchain convention, have the things you instantiate have different names

BT: almost the same as what I came up with in Jawa, either parameterize imports with args (type args), or have really tiny modules

AR: you still want to have this, C is a certain module with parameters, you want to import it from different places under that name, but give it different parameters. Can use some name mangling convention, with something denoting what it is.

CW: lot of complexity in doing this, how far can you get without this?

RT: is this like in C#, if you’re importing a generic type instantiated with specific arg, import List with type argument String to get a List[String]

AR: yea, but C is not a type/class, it is a module. Modules have type arg parameters like generic parameters.

FM: this raises a lot of problems, if C exports a type that depends on T, or doesn’t depend on T, the same type S considered the same or not the same depends on whether it references T or not. Difficult to do.

AR: Won’t disagree. It gets complicated

FM: is this a serious proposal to add type parameters?

AR: Inverting the exports of structural types is one solution that has been suggested in previous discussions, want to show how far we can take it and whether it works

RT: this doesn’t look familiar to anything i’ve seen

BT: you need to introduce type params for anything you want to reuse. Imagine C is Pair, everything you use Pair, you have to know it has type parameters

TL: looks similar to the solution to invert the structural imports and weak definitions

AR: the kind of importexport thing came out of that discussion

CW: i remember this kind of idea importexport inversion coming from older debates we have about nominal types.

TL: when this import inversion came up recently, it was about how to deal with mutually dependent/mutually recursive modules, we have since decided we don’t care about those complex things

RT: also, in that same place discussing, loaders resolve it rather than clients resolve it

AR: typically source language have nominal types, you have natural place of definition, with recursion group you have similar problems. Not reasonable to have recursion across package boundaries.

CW: agree that in the context of linking arrangement it’s not interesting, but has implication for central coordination

CW: it’s true that impotexport adds not expressiveness, it was brought up to address the concern that in nominal types, you have to decide who owns the type at compile type. If you imagine a central logic that incrementally links logic together, it can look at importexport, and decide if you want to interpret that as import or exprot at runtime

TL: any concrete patterns of import/export, can be described with normal import and exports. When you use importexport, it defers that choice to runtime. A single module graph that uses exportimport can map to multiple concrete graphs

CW: instead of define exportimport, you can add capability…

AR: some convention on the import name, then use that as an import and pass it on

CW: importexport sketches what that mechanism looks like

<BREAK>

CW: agree that regular Wasm module isn’t powerful enough to do this, the “central logic” is more about scripts in JS to link things together

CW: client modules have names they know they can access things from, but not an actual Wasm module

RT: can be unbounded number of names

AR: can be a set yes

CW: a single entry point in practice, to access all those names

AR: all imports have 2 names, module and item, you split it at module or item level, if it is virtual, doesn’t matter, multiple ways to do it here

CW: using the word module for everything makes it seem less reasonable

RT: addresses the infinite types problem, the ability for modules to ship modules with aux modules defining each type, it addresses the infinite types problem

CW: at any execution point, the central logic has a finite number of types, but unbounded, since it can always add more

RT: reflection can be what Wasm already uses, which is the name of the import

AR: if you are in the JS API yea

RT: are there other ones where import names are ignored?

AR: if you can implement a custom loader you always have this kind of reflection

RT: if a loader looks at 2 same names and decides to use 1 of them, you can solve the infinite types problem

TL: you’re saying you don’t need JS or more powerful reflection?

BT: java has Array type constructor, you need import arguments to supply a type, so the central module knows

AR: you can mangle structure type into module or item name

CW: yes, what i’ve had in mind

BT: yea implemented this, mangling everything into names is not viable

AR: mangling is not that easy here, one problem is that outside of a module you don’t have a global namespace, how to refer, in your name, to outside types

RT: rtt.canon requires you to put equirecursive into canonical form, it already requires this infrastructure

BT: what is the point of types if you encode everything into strings?

AR: once you mix structural types and nominal types, e.g. if you have WASI and import fd type, how to globally name that in your mangling scheme?

BT: wrestled with this, you can encode the bytes of the Wasm module into names of module, you can encode type defs, the actual bytes, into the name, that’s where you end up

AR: solvable, but not obvious how to scale this up. Have in mind a simple convention, then look at type bounds.  You have to reflect on the type bounds.

RT: isn’t it the same name means same import

AR: if you have mangling then yes. When you have structural types, especially recursive ones, there is no unique name. Many different ways of writing the same type. You need to canonicalize the mangling as well.

FM: if you have nominal types then you don’t try to have recursive structural types

AR: we’re compiling a source language that might have that

FM: for the same reason we don’t support mutual recursion across modules

TL: for example, source lang has equirecursive structural types, the frontend compiler for that language should do the canonicalization. Non controversial that for complex situations like that, the frontend has to do extra work

AR: there are languages with structural recursive types, such as OCaml, object types and polymorphic variants

CW: was looking at how OCaml links modules, to make sure separately compiled modules match, they hash, don’t try to at link time do structural comparison

AR: when you compile OCaml, you don’t lower structural source types to structural Wasm types. You would use a top type and encode a union, and do some casts.

CW: OCaml is not something that requires recursive structural types at Wasm level.

AR: don’t really care about mapping source level equirecursive types, but care about structural types in general. Talked to Sam Lindely, eager to compile structural recursive types in Links to structural recursive types in Wasm.

RT: even in module literature, don’t recommend this super exponential time

TL: extrapolating from what toolchains look like now, have a static linker for each one of these schemes, and a dynamic loader. Optimizers today work on a single module, if you want to run wasm-op on multiple modules, you will statically link them first.

AR: at least linkers and loaders need to understand this

CW: the convention of how these types get resolved starts at the toolchain

RT: current toolchains already do this yea?

TL: yes, we have static linkers, dynamic loaders. That’s the choice of each language team trying to compile to Wasm, how they want to extend.

CW: any environment that wants to do GC types need a place for custom loaders

TL: already need that with linear memory languages, can’t do Emscripten linking with just module linking proposal

RT: custom loader and precompute a lot, internally can resolve a lot

CW: we have to do a lot of this currently in JS, a non-web will need their own DSL for describing this

BT: even in JS, there is not enough reflection to be able to generate new type defs to link things, back to encoding everything in names and decode them

RT: or wrap modules in a layer, meta information that knows

BT: that extra meta information will be custom section with encoded type information, or names

CW: that’s exactly importexport comes in, you have a ready-made hook

BT: if you have enough info to generate types, you need to be able to import things like which field am I accessing. You can’t parameterize things over field indices

AR: good point about linear memory, this is a simpler problem. Maybe could implement purely in Wasm, fixup in start function

TL: thinking about thread local variables, weak symbols, things to implement real world C

AR: some of it is trying to reimplement existing linking solution

CW: isn’t that your argument for structural types? To replicate source structural types. 

AR: not saying it is overengineering, just illustrating other use cases

TL: j2cl not trying to replicate Java, just something that works. Anyone who is trying to replicate the full native linking story for any non-trivial language, has to do custom work and not rely on built-in Wasm. Also a big space of people trying to compile their language to Wasm, and trying to keep to Wasm linking. Not trying to be perfectly the same as source language.

CW: if you go too far the other way, you’re getting to whole program compilation anyway, then this is moot, since you know all the types

TL: good to focus on the concrete needs of users, what j2cl, kotlin, dart needs. No one is working on separate compilation now, so it’s tougher.

AR: One difference with memory issue is that, this is linking module that is language agnostic. With the types, you have more complex semantics for something that is language specific.

RT: string mangling still works for all these use cases

AR: you still need a custom loader

CW: there is a world where the custom loader is just a bag of exports, a dictionary where if you export something with a different name, it goes into it. With name mangling, how far does that get you?

BT: you won’t be able to parameterize type constructors that way, you have to mangle type arguments as a name, need to generate new names. Loader needs to decode names. Simple languages have generic types.

RT: you would say Array Array int

BT: you have to decode a string, to figure out what mytype is, decode, and bind that. Custom loader have to look at strings, decode them, generate new type.

CW: will want to see a sketch of this example

AR: a lot of complicated solutions, no one try implementing

TL: name mangling successfully used for many things, can follow up offline to see examples where it won’t work

CW: core mechanism is a dict that you can put and take names out. There may be source languages where it doesn’t work

BT: arrays in java are not simple struct, has vtable. Need to generate a new type. Need to decode mangled names, and generate new types.

CW: if you are compiling code that uses Arrays, you know which types, you can generate types.

BT: java no, unless you have the whole program

FM: in java, array is a nominal type that is generic

BT: java has funky array, covariant arrays

TL: should take this offline to look at this specific example

<slide on Diversity challenges>

FM: that’s done through coercion, we don’t try to share values across langauges

FM: multi-langauge interop is an unsolvable problem. Thought that Wasm isn’t trying to solve this problem in the context of Wasm.

AR: not talking about language speaking to each other, but just components talking to each other

FM: if you have a multi-langauge application, there is overhead associated with every different language.

RT: each component will have its own loader

LW: yea, local to that component

CW: and they don’t interact

AR: depends, don't’ know how you would make that work

LW: if you want to do runtime loading in components, and if you don’t have runtime instantiation type creation, you need to bust out loader stuff using JS API, maybe eventually we solve that by adding first class runtime instantiations

FM: can add rtt.fresh and ...

CW: seems to be the domain of interface types, everything is copied, no crazy structural type, just simple flat structs, seems like something that wouldn’t affect the design of core GC proposal, since we made inter-lang interp a non-goal.

AR: not about languages talking together, talking about centralization problem in the face of multiple centers

RT: if they are not talking together, the nominal ypes don’t need centers

AR: how do you set up multiple centers

CW: from POV of one centers, other centers don’t exist

TL: application level has global knowledge to set them all up

AR: this is not unsolvable, but not obvious

RT: prior work in this space of typed assembly lans show that the types are the things that are hard to get right, validating all access are safe is hard

AR: agree, even more reason to put into language and not defer

RT: things that can scale are the nominal ones

BT: nominal v.s. Structural aside, we need to put a place to put this logic, is it outside the VM, in userspace with superpowers beyond what Wasm offers today, what are those powers? It looks to me like moving this to userspace is really complicated

RT: only if doing separate compilation. Everything can be done with whole program

BT: separate compilation and expecting lowered code to interop, will never work right. Can’t emulate source semantics or platform. There will be a runtime system. Lowered code between same lang or different be type-safe or interop won’t work. Don’t think we are honest with ourselves about that.

AR: e.g. in Java with dynamic loading and JIT, yes that’s the case

BT: security model associated in source language, Java’s whole module is violated once you can link lowered code. Get around things that are not possible with just bytecode. Wasm doesn’t provide security guarantees that JVM does.

CW: in the past we have considered a virtue to keep Wasm small, push this kind of logic into a level above us, here, push into toolchain. To replicate C’s linking semantics, we pushed all logic into tools and tools-generated JS. Maybe in the future it is JS and module linking proposal. In other situations we would consider this a virtue, deferring how to manage types into toolchain.

AR: don’t think so, this is a genuine part of the semantics, what is type equivalence. Outsourcing a central part of the semantics seems not such a great idea. We have made different decisions in different cases, whether it makes sense to put things into engines or toolchains. We haven’t been totally consistent. Driven by other considerations.

TL: as tool author, prefer to keep tools simple. Our philosophy has been, we are pushing as much as cost and complexity into tools. Conflicting here, want Wasm engines to be simple, security risk there. When we have structural types, all this sharing, it is a lot simpler for producers. The performance cost of doing equirecursive cost on engines is too high.

AR: consciously not talked about equirecursive, that is an orthogonal question

CW: only if we have an alternative proposal

AR: next part of the presentation

BT: primarily think about engine complexity, moving this into userspace seems really complicated, considering all the layers, it will be even more complicated if this is not in the engine.

AR: if we don’t need equirecursion, what we put in engine is not complicated, really just hash consing.

CW: complexity of doing something at engine level that supports all lang that wants to compile to Wasm, will be more than any toolchain that wants to implement. Equi-canon is what engines will need to implement.

AR: structural recursion, not equi

RT: many examples where structural types are more convenient for languages, but for them we can use nominal types too, with some effort. Other problems, the flipside isn’t true.

AR: none of these claims are true

CW: should shut down this conversation, bounded quant is post-post-post MVP

BT: meta-level - need to align on shipping something that people will use. Many things down the road we can think about, and many iterations. We need to actually make progress forward.

RT: need to figure out the overhead making 5x slower

CW: mvp will have so many casts that it will be slow

FM: no point shipping something 5x slower

TL: recent perf numbers are better than 5x slower, not as bad. Agree to align on shipping something

RT: kotlin tried to do separate compilation and couldn’t get it to work

AR: yea could be true, but can have many reasons for that, doesn’t mean we should give up on separate compilation

RT: the issues were how MVP expresses and composes types, insufficient for them

BT: when you use type across module boundary, you can’t refer to fields, that’s missing

RT: importing bounded types…

CW: any reasonable MVP will replicate these issues, unless we go to the extensions RT talked about

AR: yea, have to add a lot of things to support that

CW: equirec types as implementing in target language, is also untested

AR: we have tested it to some degree, why we are having this discussion, not one has tested this (self-hosting)

CW: if we want to switch, we should test what we switch to

TL: have the theme for next meeting be alternative solutions, and multiple presenters

FM: are we talking about another two-hour session

TL: go back to an hour, be open to occasional two-hour

RT: have meetings more productive by having them be presented in issues first

TL: yea can share an issue, agree that’s helpful

CW: you can get into infinite regress by responding to each other. Would like to see examples of name mangling being insufficient

BT: yea i can come up with that example
