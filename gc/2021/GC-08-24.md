### Presentation: Update on Binaryen optimizations (Alon Zakai, 20 minutes)

[slides](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/gc/2021/presentations/2021-08-24-zakai-optimization-update.pdf)

ZB: Good on Dart in what sense? Is it faster than JS version for Dart?

AZ: Similar to Dart AOT output, which I believe is faster than the JS output generally. There might be some things where JS wins because of the JIT.

BT: About cast elimination: if I understand right, the rtt comes from a global so you canâ€™t erase it, but in the nominal system there is no dynamic value. What is it about rtt that makes it different?

AZ: you can do that there, we can do it for ref.cast, larger issue is ref.test that don't trap. For things that do trap, we can, which is why we have TrapsNeverHappen

ZB (chat): So, after all this optimisations j2cl for wasm is still slower than JS?

AZ: At the moment yes, some of that is missing general optimizations in binaryen or other parts of the toolchain. No precise answer to what remains, but looking at profiling data.

BT: Another thing to evaluate is the memory size of J2CL vs Java. You can have a more optimized object layout in Wasm.

AZ: definitely true, packed fields is one thing I hope will make a big difference, more efficient memory storage

ZB (chat): Do you have information about size of binaries? for j2cl

AZ: too early to say, haven't focused on measuring that yet, focused on speed for now. It will become interesting to measure later.

DE: do these optimizations work with type imports?

AZ: have not thought about how they interact there, focused on the closed world case for now, will need to think about that. Now the assumptions is that no types come in or go out

RT: you assume you can collect all the info about the types, if the type is exported, other people can write to that type

AZ: right now we assume closed-world, if the types escape we will need to do something more careful

LW: do toolchain only thing, where the toolchains can do thing slike traps never happen, can say assume we've seen all the writes

RT: do you have examples of constant prop that aren't vtables?

AZ: In some cases, integers that happen to be propagated don't end up being significant for speed, calls are the main factor. The code doesn't care about type, any constant it can handle.

ZB: Would be useful to have code splitting or to be able to optimise bunch of wasm files together with CW assumption

AZ: interesting question, we will want code splitting after this closed-world stuff

### Discussion: Evaluating nominal types (Ben Titzer, 20 minutes)

[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kq7gPQ_ukj1gcZVliMKZmCiv9f1iV-3q9nJkbPzbYSk/edit?usp=sharing)

CW: given how much work Binaryen has done in prototyping, we need a alternative to prototype against it, Andreas' latest sketch seems something to compare. If just compare Binaryen equirecursive, it won't be fair, because we know the equirecursive won't work.

TL: concretely, we have been doing a bunch of work with nominal types, the next question to answer is, if we get rid of RTT, and use nominal declared subtypes, what performance wins can we realize from that. That will require engine implementation to answer. Coming up with a new prototype spec document so that Binaryen and V8 can implement. Putting together now, ready to share soon. In particular this new document is designed so you can gracefully upgrade from equirecursive program to experiment with nominal types.

CW: BT is pitching this in terms of, we have a structural design, we should do the work for nominal. In the engine, right now most of the work is in nominal. We need resources to implement the structural types in engine.

TL: was out last week, just from notes, don't have a strong understanding of it yet to implement it. need a more detailed technical write-up. Will be happen to then go implement it in Binaryen. Don't think we need it in v8 yet.

CW: will be on Andreas to write something more detailed

BT: assuming that the best version of structural types that Andreas proposed 2 weeks ago will be what we will be prototyping. What binaryen and v8 seems like a side project, i want to bring it into the main fold.

TL: finishing that document, and happy to take into account any thoughts yall have. Will be great to implement these. E.g. in Wizard.

BT: yup, thats my plan

RT: another pro, when you explore multiple paths, you often find that an idea on one path improves the other path

BT: when i implement in Wizard, I follow the ref interpreter, what's in the binary code, stick with the CG documents

RT: AR is not here to express concerns

BT: worth taking the temperature of the room

Poll, we will evaluate nominal types by adding the minimum delta necessary (types and instructions) to the current MVP and tools.

SF: 8
F: 8
N: 1
A: 0
SA: 0

### Discussion: Encapsulation and Privacy (Conrad Watt, 20 minutes)

CW: in many source languages, you have privacy or package designators, like private fields. Has come up in discussions that particular patterns of making fields private would be better supported by 1 version of the type system or another version. We have an opportunity to limit the scope, or we can decide we care about this. We should decide one way or another. When this comes up, opinions in the room are split. We never decided this at the group level. I believe it shouldn't be a concern for the MVP. Hot-take: questionable whether the kind of privacy modifiers you get in Java should ever be in Wasm level. Do you consider these modifiers a feature for security? or source-level abstraction, a way for programmers to produce an interface to shape human behaviors, as opposed to sound security. Depending on where you fall, it doesn't have to be in core Wasm, but can be a toolchain thing, because even if VM don't guarantee, using toolchain conventions, checking for private fields, you can support it. Do we want robust privacy features, or would you be happy with something more restrictive that depends on toolchain for source linking behaviors. Will point to previous soft consensus that we can't make every source language linking abstraction to core Wasm.

FM: it's a privacy issue, not a source language compatibility/semantics. Also a strong privacy/security aspect.

CW: you can have a setup that if you compile your Java program to Wasm, and only ever link it to other modules compiled through the same toolchain, then the private field is protected, but won't get that if you expose to other arbitrary modules.

FM: that is not strong enough. if i have a library, i have no control over who link it

CW: if you have a GC for linear memory, you don't have the guarantee right now

FM: argument also applies if you go to the machine code, you can figure out what to do. I would be unhappy if I was a java compiler promogator.

DE: how does this related to type imports, when you can wrap a whole value in this opaque thing.

FM: it is not enough, if i want to subclass a type.

DE: at module boundary, all or nothing might be enough, JS supports subclassing and adding public fields without adding indirection. Think a producer can emulate that.

BT: java linking allows many different kind of changes. fragile base class problem. You can have a private field which is an indirection away. A private field can become a public field, java linking is fine with that. Privacy of field changes the object model, can't do the same link time check as you would in java.

FM: that feature of Java is changing in recent version of Java, in the teens version of Java. If you have a private field you can't make it public, can't get it through introspection.

DE: seems like supporting full java semantics will be far beyond what we can do with the GC proposal, not sure if we should be treating that as a goal.

BT: supporting full Java linking requires a whole different thing, won't be able to introduce Wasm mechanisms to do that

KM: in the JS world, there are entire framework type things like SES designed to try and embed secure env, like a plugin on your webpage. Big nightmare for them. Possible that having something built into the system will make their lives easier. OTOH, I am not necessarily a champion of this.

AZ: most comments are on privacy, also optimization, if a field is private, closed-world

TL: there are use cases that benefit from this, nice to have. Will say this is post-mvp, design without thinking about it, so we can focus on performance and code size, those are the key issues that will break or make this whole enterprise

RT: ability to handle privacy and separate compilation means we have a good way of composing systems together, test of a good compositional system. In nominal type space, everything is private by default, you have to give public access explicitly, not more work to make privacy happens. We want to consider interop, DE pointed out structs proposal, can mark JS classes as fixed, another proposal for JS with private fields, and guarantee they are strongly encapsulated. Combing that with Wasm, make sure Wasm is respecting that privacy.

TL: propose that we continue to try and settle the type system question without bringing privacy concerns into the mix, simplify the conversation. Once we settle that, we can evaluate how easily we can put privacy mechanisms into MVP. If it is easy we can go ahead to do it, otherwise holding off to post-mvp is better. Key decision now is the type system question without considering privacy.

FM: two questions that are conflated. 1 is this language semantics or security issue. 2 is do we do this now or later. No opinion on 2, happy to leave to post-mvp. I don't think this is only a language-only question.

CW: if i were to grant that it is a security question, is it something that must be solved by a core extension to Wasm, or toolchain

FM: cannot trust toolchain, won't be enough

LW: different scenarios, when i'm linking c object files, when i'm linking code from totally different languages

FM: agree

CW: if we were to end up going with structural types the path to adding privacy seems harder, might be a completely orthogonal thing. We should be prepared that we end up with structural types, then find it almost impossible to extend that to add private fields. We need to be okay with that.

TL: what's in type imports proposal is basically that, layering nominal on top of structural system in GC proposal

RT: awareness of this is important

TL: sounds like we are in agreement, design core type system without considering privacy

(no disagreement)

CW: re BT's poll, given the plan of work in Binaryen and V8, the new work commitment is to prototype a structural thing to compare the nominal type system with

TL: reasonable, we can consider next steps for structural system after we have the doc

BT: we will have the union in the MVP for some time

TL: even if we don't end up shipping the union, we will have it for experimenting

RT: productive discussions today
