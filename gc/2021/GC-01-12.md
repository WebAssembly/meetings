Non-terminating example

BT: Doesn’t this non-determination mean you’re missing a rule? If you add a new axiom to decide one way or another, then you’re all set, right?

RT: That would require an infinite set of rules that may or may not be computable.

BT: There’s no small set of rules that could fix it?

RT: No. Will show a more complex example shortly.

F<= As a register machine

CW: Is there anything meaningful about nominal / structural types here?

RT: If you have a nominal type, it behaves as a counter that gets smaller on each proof step. So the nominal type bounds how long the proof can go on.

CW: If you plunk nominal types in then everything works out, then?

RT: Will have a slide on that shortly.

Inheritance and generic methods

RT: Does that answer your question?

CW: Not quite but it’s a good example. If you had a language with reified generics, …

RT: You need to validate this kind of inheritance (or insert casts everywhere).

CW: In e.g. Kotlin the types are erased before reaching WebAssembly, this wouldn’t matter. So this would matter more for something like C#?

RT: Right.

FM: Why does erasure matter?

CW: If the types are erased before WebAssembly, then you must be ok using casts everywhere and you’re not encoding these relationships in WebAssembly’s type system.

Writing to Java/C#/Kotlin Arrays

CW: Bartok compiler uses this encoding. Are there other examples?

RT: I believe Bartok is the only one that represents the full language with a typed assembly language.

F<= is too weak

CW: Are these strong rules meant to avoid needing explicit pack/unpack operations?

RT: Pack and unpack operations would not be sufficient to demonstrate the subtyping in this case. Work on representing Java with structural low level types could not support covariant arrays due to these issues.

End

TL: What would you say the biggest takeaway from this is for the GC work?

RT: We will need to stratify the type system between structure and high-level invariant if we want to support cast-free arrays.

TL: Any studies on performance impact of cast-freedom?

RT: Only the ones Jakob has done. Folks haven’t explored the space of having some casts typed and others untyped like we’re doing in WebAssembly. Other systems reason about user casts as well as implicit casts.
