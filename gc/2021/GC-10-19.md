### Presentation: Wob (Andreas Rossberg, 30 minutes)

TODO: links to slides

RT: do you have interfaces?

AR: No interfaces, will get to what I don’t have.

BT: can you downcast from readonly arrays to mutable arrays?

AR: Arrays are not objects, so you cannot cast them at all. But you could wrap them up in an object and then cast that wrapper.

FM: why did you do Wob? what kind of experiments do you see being able to run with Wob?

AR: want to have something to experiment with and see if certain language features can be compiled. When I started this, Dart wasn't that far along yet, and other compilers like J2CL and Dart used whole compilation, I wanted to evaluate support for separate compilation with the current proposal, in both OO and functional setting. Don't think anyone has looked into how to implement currying.

FM: One reason for asking is that there are performance pain points that are showing up. Do you anticipate being able to run experiments about those?

AR: performance eval is not my first interest here, only validating expressiveness first, that I can actually compile, even though it's slower than I wanted. Performance evaluation is the second step after that. The compiler doesn't do fancy optimization, a one-pass compiler. One thing we can look at e.g. is where I use cast. Can get an idea of what constructs induce extra costs.

FM: will be interesting to look at performance down the road

AR: yes, I am interested as well, will be quite a bit of work to get sufficient optimizations. For straight line code it probably doesn't matter that much, worth playing with.

RT: if your goal is to eval separate compilation, what happens if you make tuples into objects?

AR: You mean like with a wrapper type?

RT: what other languages do, this is a class with vtable and operators on it?

AR: not sure what exactly your question is targeting. You can implement them as classes, it would be less efficient. Is your question about representation?

RT: A common issue is that particular tuple types need their corresponding particular vtables. How would you support that in your compilation scheme?

AR: good question, I don't know. There are reasons to not make them objects, think it is a bad langauge design. Will need to be solved as well, if you have a language with that semantics

BT: do tuples have identity in wob?

AR: reference identity. The obvious way around it is just box everything. Tuples are represented as arrays essentially. Easy way to get around separate compilation. But you miss the unboxing representation.

RT: then no longer have this 8^N issue as well

AR: doesn't seem particularly desirable. How you have unboxed structural types...

RT: C# does this as a concrete example

AR: C# uses runtime JIT-ting, which we don't have

RT: you can pre-generate, JIT is something it does to have faster load times

AR: not actually true in general, it is true with <missed this> but not with respect to type identity

FM: if you have a tuple variable with generic argument, will it match with a non generic value?

AR: when you compose and embed them you have to lower to eqref for that reason

FM: you wouldn't permit generic tuple with a byte

AR: you can have a tuple with generic type, but can't abstract over the byte type, only over the boxed byte type. No difference from Java.

TL: does the first class polymorphism imply that you need RTT values you need to pass into generic methods

AR: yes, need a runtime rep for types, will talk about it quite a bit

BT: do you canonicalize these type representation objects, or do deep comparison on cast?

AR: at the moment do not canonicalize, but you will want to do that in production quality implementation

FM: if you have a source level cast, you run a little proof that the thing you want to know is the right type in this sort of AST of types you have, then Wasm adds its own casting, then you're doing casting twice. Have you thought about how to organize this so that if the source level proof works, the the Wasm cast is implied

AR: how do you convince Wasm, without a powerful type system, that your source cast is right? What can work is to try to piggyback custom casts on Wasm casts, but we will need more features on the Wasm side as well.

BT: how exactly does that work? vtables have types themselves?

AR: vtable is struct, has to be struct since function types are diff

BT: this is the cast after you cast the wasm level struct

AR: this is the wasm level struct representing the vtable,

RT: lots of implementation of reified generics instead of putting type in objects, they put it in vtable

AR: But then you would need a new vtable for each instantiation.

RT: Usually that’s done during linking.

AR: Not good enough.

RT: Then have hashmap then get canonicalization for it

AR: usually the number of class in hierarchy is dominated by number of methods, not a deep hierarchy where every class just adds one method

RT: point of this is to eliminate T, so instance are smaller objects

AR: yes, that would make the instance object smaller. It's similar to what JS engine does, where construction time constant fields are merged into V8 map/shape object, various ways you can skin this, this is the simplest one

RT: concern here is how the separate compilation scheme would work if the type representations were stored on the vtables rather than the instances, as is the standard.

AR: I’m not sure that’s the standard representation, but either way I haven’t thought about it.

FM: null thing is interesting, there are different null values for all different types

AR: quite annoying we don't have a null type, need to jump through hoops

RT: the issue about canon becomes important with interfaces, you need to canon for that to be efficient

AR: yea, think we will want canonicalization

RT: this is not canonicalization that any of the stuff currently supports, manually done through loading, on your own?

AR: yes

RT: also need canonicalize the vtable first for production systems

AR: vtables don't necessarily require canon, in practice that would be needed, won't affect the casts though
