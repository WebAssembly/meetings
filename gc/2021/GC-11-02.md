AR: is this specific to GC proposal, or more general?

BT: it is more general

AR: surfaces mainly in GC proposal, if we want a broader discussion, should take it to CG

BT: yes, planning to present about interpreters in a month or so

AR: wouldn't call it IR, it's just an AST

BT: AST is a form of an IR

FM: V8 doesn't have an interpreter anymore

BT: yea I know, it is moved into test only, think it is a mistake

FM: How do you get O(1) access to the side table?

BT: xip starts at beginning, first instruction we come to will be pointing to the right thing, if the "if" falls through, advance xip, if we go to "else" will add by value of xip.

KM: if you fall through the if, you just add 4? what about br_table

BT: yea, br_table have table of entries, compute offset into table

CW: what is eip?

BT: end instruction pointer, when you fall off the end you return

CW: this is done per function?

BT: yup. You can go to the function, go to the code, look at the length. But there are a lot of end opcodes, I think this is faster.

RT: for control you have extended code, you can do it for other instructions too right?

BT: you can, but not needed. For example, there are a lot of LEBs in the bytecode that are slow to decode. You could imagine having a decoded i32.const value in a side table, but it turns out LEBs are small in practice.

AR: when you say per bytecode, you mean per struct instruction? Do we have any idea how frequent they are?

BT: Aske has done some space studies,

ASC: struct.get was one of the most common instruction, local.get was the most common, 100k, struct.get with 26k.

KM: in the whole module? or just function or code section?

ASC: whole module. 25% of the most common one, for a 1.5 MB module, 26k struct.get, 10k struct.set.

AR: you wouldn't need to inline these 3 or 4 values each time. You can have the module global field index in the side table.

BT: yea, wouldn't put it inline, it basically undoes the space optimization of making that struct relative

AR: validation gets somewhat cheaper, you have fewer checks

BT: not sure about that until we measure it

AR: not sure how much difference, but certainly fewer check

AR: whether select is a specific case depends on impl strategy, you might consider drop a similar case. Depending on how you organize your stack, you don't know the size either.

BT: The way I did things, it really is madness to consider anything except a uniform value representation.

AR: why does select have a problem?

BT: for an interpreter, what select is pop and i32, look at it, then choose one of the two, copy the tag down, it will drop 1 thing or copy 1 thing, it doesn't look at tag. a baseline/optimizing JIT, whether it is an i32 or i64, it might be in different registers, generate different code, whereas interpreter is tag agnostic. I implemented a version that doesn't keep the tags, right now the tag only used for a precise GC.

AR: maybe I misunderstand that you're saying select is a problem for interp

BT: yea turns out it isn't

AR: agree that memory savings undone by side tables. This is only for interpreters, optimizing compilers will not construct these side tables. Also, it won't be much worse in terms of space usage, it ends up being equivalent for side tables v.s. code. Engine complexity is a fair point, however you need to implement this infrastructure already, you need that one way or another. If you use a side-table, you can at least organize it in a manner that is more adequate to your interpreter, you might gain something there, maybe with lookup time.

BT: The main advantage of having an interpreter is to save space, so making any trade off that uses more space is bad for interpreters.

AR: we're not wasting it right, we are moving it elsewhere. It's not getting worse for interpreter.

KM: it will be dirty memory, in theory your code can be disk-backed.

BT: if field_index was struct relative, it wouldn't be useful to interp, I would store a module relative index, it is wasted information, wasted space

KM: I also think increasing wire size is bad for a lot of things, especially for web apps shipping 50 MB modules, if you make that 10% larger, now it is 55 MB, pretty brutal on slow connection. Not super concerned with side-table, need to keep in mind how hard it is to create side table.

BT: side table only needed for control flow, adding new kind of entry adds complexity. Worst code in V8's Wasm engine is probably in validator, reason is because it is templated, used by 3 different tiers, didn't want to write it 3 times. All the tiers need to piggy-back on the type reconstruction. If you add more things to it to record the breadcrumbs for side-table, it gets worse.

KM: don't find it as true in JSC, curious what it is like for Firefox

AR: one trap we could run in is, considering too specific an implementation and drawing conclusion from it. V8 makes certain choices, some good, some terrible. What should we conclude from that? Do we optimize design around certain implementation techniques?

BT: in practice we also do consider the implementation complexity, part of the impl feedback process. I'm not advocating we do everything exactly for Wizard's interpreter, that'll be a mistake, i've changed my mind too. OTOH, the bigger point is that we need enough immediates in the code so that we can look at bytecode and know how to execute it. That's a property which is useful for multiple different things.

AR: the exact interpretation of that depends on your implementation. An example is the cast instruction should just have the n there, maybe that's the information you need for one impl, but not for another. Same with indices. If we put information there, it is sufficiently abstract to not assume what information engines need to execute something. Have to generalize there a bit, not too specific.

TL: running low on time here, a lot to discuss, take it offline for now, move on to next agenda item.

AR: we have discussed this a number of times, at a f2f meeting we had a decision, fine to revisit, wondering how to make progress. Too bad we can't have f2f, maybe we can start thinking about that soon. This will be easier to resolve f2f.

TL: this comes down to fundamental goals for what Wasm should be and its goals, comes up in GC, also need to get wider consensus from CG. BT presenting on interpreters to CG, might be good to continue discussion there.

### Presentation: Waml (Andreas Rossberg, 30+ minutes)

[slides](presentations/2021-10-19+-rossberg-wob.pdf)

FM: i guess it started as an experiment for you to figure out what it takes to implement an OO language in Wasm. I propose a slight modification. There are times when we have issues with language implementation, vtables, java style classes, dart style classes, which we don't want to experiment with by modifying a java compiler. One possible future for wob could be a platform for making implementation experiments.

AR: first line of experiment is whether the current proposal supports what i want it to support, and how easy it is. Equally, I tried to keep it simple so it can be used as a platform for experimenting with alternative designs

FM: e.g. casting. Know that wob has its own source-level casting, it is of interest only to wob, not other languages. How to deal with wasm-level casting will be of interest.

AR: a slide summarizing wasm-level cast, have a similar one for waml compiler, 3 main places it uses cast, that's a relevant insight you want from experiments like this. What we expected, how bad it is, which casts we can avoid.

RT: for uniform representation, eqref for wob, for waml it's not eqref?

AR: waml also uses eqref

RT: not anyref anymore? 

AR: nope, don't need anyref here. anyref might show up if you have some kind of ffi, if you imported some externref you want to use, you probably want to abstract from externref v.s. language value, then you need anyref

RT: with externref you can't downcast, hard to mix them together.

AR: for the ffi setup you do downcast, but only externally. Internally it's an abstract type, no reason to downcast within Wasm.

RT: for wob, generics, you can't generically quantify over primitives, what happens if you try that?

AR: you need more boxing. In waml you can quantify over every type, you have to use uniform representation in more places.

RT: talking about without changing how you represent values. In some languages, tuple<int, int> stored as tuple int int, if you use in generic code, tuple<x,y>, x and y accesses box/unbox it.

AR: two ways to implement this, run time code specialization, C#, we can't properly do in Wasm.

RT: Tuple<X,Y>. Getting the first field is via a vtable call that returns the first field in the uniform representation.

AR: that isn't about uniform representation, that's about implementing tuples as objects, and abstracting over accessors, uniform representation to me is representing everything as eqref. doesn't imply using vtables, you can, but that's a choice.

TL: will be cool to experiment with these different strategies

AR: agree, limitations to what we can do with current proposal
