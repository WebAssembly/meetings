### Discussion: Iso-recursive types

[slides](presentations/2021-05-18-rossberg-iso-recursion.pdf)

TL: will there be any problems if each type inside recursion group got its own type index?

AR: alternate design, have some slides later on to suggest this

LW: just to see how this is observable, if A exported u, and B extracted the export u from its instance, and then try to use export u and internal u, and they weren't the same?

AR: The simplest way would be if A exports a function that also uses A’s $u in its signature and B tries to use B’s $u with it.

RT: how many more slides are there?

AR: not that many, 2 slides about alternative, and summary slides

TL: motivation is to get to discussion?

RT: want to make sure there is time for discussion

FM: example of a language that uses equi-recursive structural types

AR: ocaml, typescript, Scala but it uses JVM reflection

BT: order dependence, doesn't it mean if you export a type, you need to define in minimal recursion groups

AR: You don’t have to, but you probably want to. You could define all the types in your module in one big recursion group, but that’s less useful. 

JK: on order depdennce, in first design it is clear we need it, with flatten index is it still order dependence? why?

AR: Yes because that dependence is ingrained in this structure that is a tuple over types. Comparing equality if the tuple is not ordered would be complicated.

RT: any case studies done with this?

AR: no

RT: looked this up in OO languages?

AR: nominally type OO languages, no problem. It is as expressive as nominal plus more, any nominal can be mapped. You need this at module boundaries for linking for nominal types, essentially iso recursive at link type, that's what you check against.

RT: What about subtyping? How do you deal with a non-recursively defined class being extended by a class that is mutually recursive with other classes.

	class A
	rec-class B <: A
	B and C are mutually recursive

AR: what would be the problem? it wouldn't get recursive just by extending it. B and C would be recursive but not with A.

RT: Mutually recursive group, a member of that, a non thing, and they are not lining up. How is B a subtype of A?

BT: subtyping is totally orthogonal, recursive relation over types, only time it comes up is immutable field, anything else is a check. The recursion we have now for width and depth subtyping for structs, just works out.

TL: no problem having a type in a recursion group, be a subtype of another type not in a recursion group?

AR: this might be actually a reason to allow nesting of recursion groups. Because you basically have recursion over recursive things. The subtyping rule for iso-rec is one rec group is subtype of another rec-group if you have both depth and width subtyping on components. Means that you can only extend one group in one dimension at a time. But if you have two mutually recursive classes, then the recursion group, for each clas the recursion between methods, then recursion between the two classe, which is one level up. The inner one want to be a subtype, but not on the combined thing.

RT: I understand it's complicated, asking if you have worked through to see if it works

AR: no, not in that detail. I'm pretty confident that it works sufficiently well, iso-recursive is often used as the type theorteic model of nominal types

RT: some red flags in representation. E.g. non-uniform recursion and how it is decidable. But it is known that non-uniform recursion that can handle OO subtyping, then it is undecidable

CW: Undecidable in the presence of bounded quantification?

RT: No, generics are undecidable with iso-recursive types without bounded quantification. Follows from the [paper](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/58183/7/javats.pdf) by Radu Grigore as I presented to the group back in [December](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/gc/2020/GC-12-15.md).

AR: if there is something that is decidable, and decidable for nominal types, pretty sure it is undecidable fo rmodule linking, we have a problem anyway. At the module level you have to get structural.

RT: depends on how deep you go, first import nominal types, then link, how C# and Java works

AR: you have no global namespace, all you have structures

RT: C# has decidable and nominal linking.

LW: it has global namespace, we can't have that in Wasm

RT: no, you import the module that defines the names

AR: java doesn't have safe linking, class loader is kind of the global namespace. In C#, not sure how linking happens that, understanding is that it is conceptually similar even when modelled in different way

TL: probably good to have presentation on C# linking

RT: we don't know if this can handle OO languages, we don't concretely understand…

AR: for anything we design, there are aspects of languages we can't handle.

RT: you put on your slide, equirecursive types, we don't know languages, but for OO we know. We can't handle all languages, but if we cannot handle Java and C#, two popular languages.

CW: does java have the right kind of generics, impression was reified generics

RT: java has arrays, one way that java implements vtable canon for array is to have a field in the class, that says vtable for arrays, non-uniform recursion, those arrays are variant, if you extend iso-rec to support variance it becomes undecidable. Even for user-defined generics arrays.
So the problem comes up due to Java arrays, even though user-defined generics are erased.

AR: we need to explore this to figure out what works and doesn't, no easy answer. I'm convinced that there are things that won't work, but that's true in any direction. I mentioned some things I know won't work, not sure how relevant they are. Might have ways to work around that. We always have things to work around. If there is a work-around then it's a question of how expensive and how common it is.

TL: thinking about prototyping this in Binaryen with least churn possible, would it be sufficient to take the type section that is currently emmited and find the strongly connected components to define the recursion group and just pretend it was defined as those groups all along, and do canonicalization. This will break down in theory for some use case, but for common basic use case in producers, will that work? or any immediate issues you see.

AR: for performance? That should work for canonicalization.

RT: probably won't validate anymore

TL: why?

RT: if people make their own subtype hierarchies, and i have in there a rec-group, and subtype of something in that rec-group.

TL: this is the problem of A B and C you discussed earlier. I will think of how to hackily prototype it.

AR: just to measure canonicalization performance its fine

TL: true, validation doesn't matter, but it would be nice to have something working end-to-end.

AR: all you care about is bottom-up canonicalization and see how fast it is

TL: okay, thanks both

AR: when i tried the test case, binaryen or whoever emits this seems to use a dependent index space for field index spaces, i had to hack ref interp to handle that. for symbolic field indices in text format, they would be per-struct, and that won't fly because it only works if we have both the type index and field index on struct.get, we want to get rid of former, so you can't resolve it syntactically

TL: you mean with iso-rec

AR: nope, completely independent, we were discussing removing more type annotations, struct.get won't have type of struct anymore in syntax, you won't know where to lookup the field in which type if you just desugar it, you would need full type-checking, which breaks the idea of symbolic identifiers, we can't support that in the future.

AR: the labels are local, like in C, don't think it works here.

TL: might have issue on this, can file an issue

AR: works right now, won't work when we change it.
