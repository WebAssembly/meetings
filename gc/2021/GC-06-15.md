AR: understand that you need a downcast, in my compiler, only need it for overriding method, why do you need Object instead of base class, first class that introduces the method.

RL: You’re right that you only need to use the first class that observed the method.

AR: then only need a downcast when you override the method, most won’t need

GG: general case has extra cast, kind of the limitation of represent in Wasm type system, not something we can prove using the current type system

RL: Interface methods will need some sort of general top type because it’s a tree rather than a graph.

RT: seems like you’re using whole program compilation, you don’t even need the vtable unless you have overriding methods

RL: yes, we have a basic model that we are presenting, we have a pipeline of optimizations. Eventually we only have methods that are not overridden. But in the general case being presented, we potentially have an extra casting in the method prolog

RT: surprised that i-table is not stored in v-table, you’re making your objects larger

RL: this is a trade-off, simple change to design and compiler for us, have not tried these experiments. Can trade off extra indirection for some memory in the object. For now we went for the extra memory.

AR: how do you implement cast on array type?

RL: In Java arrays have object semantics. So we have a struct that represents the Array object and internally it contains an array. The cast would be on the struct.

AR: wondering about casts specifically, the cast semantics is different from all other classes, it is the only true generic

RL: at the moment, we have nto implemented the full semantic of casts for arrays. We distinguish between objects and each of the primitive types. Plan is to keep a metadata in the array, that you can check to do the cast. We use a similar technique in JS, keep a metadata to do the cast, and array store exception.

RT: Is your wasm representation of a string array…?

RL: the wasm type is the same for all arrays of references, will be the same wasm struct. We have different for primitive arrays

GG: all array accesses need to have casts

FM: anything you can share about performance

RL: preliminary benchmarks, current performance is not great, is slower than JS performance, 20% slower to 5x slower. But we haven’t done any optimization on our part yet. Normally in JS we have a lot of optimizations to eliminate virtual dispatch and code size. We don’t have any yet in our prototype. Some of it is expected.

GG: we rely on what binaryen provides. We don’t leverage our global knowledge yet. In jS we have a lot of custom optimizations for our code patterns.

RT: for interoperability, if a java class has method foo and you can call foo from JS with the same name...

RL: For interop in J2CL we use annotations that let you mark methods as being from JS. You can use the normal names in JS.

RT: reason for annotation is to avoid overloading conflicts?

RL: we have to mangle names for lowering, we have a pattern for mangling to make the names user friendly. If you have a JS class, you want to be able to call it in J2CL, you can declare it and mark methods, rename methods, can present to Java.

GG: in the J2CL case, it is rich, you can mix and match js and java types, within a single hierarchy, can have hamburgers of types. Which is kind of crazy but useful for migration purposes. Migrated lots of JS code to Java preserving semantics. Very rich, probably won’t need as much, or can’t. For migration you’ll have the same problem, moving boundary between the 2 systems. Annotations change how we emit constructor to fit into ES6. That part is completely hand-wavy in current prototype to make basic pieces work. For something in practice we need something much richer.

RT: I could see JS classes extending Java classes [note: other way?] but not the other way.

AR: scala is more restrictive. Scala.js you have 2 mechanisms for defining scala class, one completely opaque to JS, one that is usable from JS, they are separate mechanisms, don’t think you can mix and match them. A “native” scala class, exported to JS, it is an object with a null prototype, no methods, IIRC. they don’t bother doing any of that.

GG: we had one global optimization that understands both languages. J2Cl was originally GWT, GWT was originally doing opaque objects. J2CL moved to one global optimizer, we didn’t need to have 2 different class structure. We need to handle overloads etc to make semantics work, we didn’t need that 2 class structure.

RT: There are known implementation techniques allowing untyped code to extend typed code, but I don’t know about the other direction.

FM: can you talk about developer experience, someone using J2CL, what’s it like using devtools

GG: there are 2 parts, the debugging side, we have source maps support, that’s more recent and kind of works, but some limitations. We cannot inspect memory, see underlying representation, can’t customize formatters for types. Inspecting strings harder, need to see internal representation of string. Need to understand lots of internal pieces and layout. Wrt development, quite limited, we have limited JS interop, didn’t need something richer.

FM: will be interesting to compare dev ex of someone targeting JS v.s. Wasm. The other is how is devtools for debugging J2CL code.

GG: J2CL case, we develop source maps. Due to limitation of source maps, people end up using original JS code for debugging. In J2CL we have a goal of making our classes to be understandable, part of the design goals. Unlike GWT, was trying to target JS like a binary, cannot debug much. In J2CL case you see ES6 class, method names, mangled but readable, even without source maps, they can go through JS code, they really know what is going on. For people who don’t have much experience on the JS, they use source maps. Generally J2CL is close to hand-written JS code. On Wasm it is totally different. We will see how it will turn out. Right now we are just targeting this, we don’t have a huge developer base yet.

RT: what is some thing that are problematic about compiling to JS that you are hoping will be better with Wasm.

GG: one biggest issue is lack of primitives, e.g. all numbers are effectively emulated with double. Types commonly used like int, we need to instrument them. Luckily it helps V8 figure it is int, but in terms of code size. It affects our interop. Numerics I expect big improvement. Essentially the lack of type information, not well communicated to the engine. We wanted JS with richer type systems, can communicate with the engine. Wasm is a way to reach that potential. Maybe in the future we can look at async/late loading of code. That was built on existing JS concept, maybe Wasm will have first class support for this. See it as a clean start, of what we were abusing in JS.

GG: one other thing that might be worthwhile, the lack of system libraries. In J2CL case, we were heavily using the existing libraries in the browser. They are usually native implemented, performant, already shipped in the browser, doesn’t require downloading. In Wasm case, you need to replicate a lot of things, in most cases they are slower, and add to the download size.

FM: following-on from RT, is there something you’ld like Wasm to have but not on the roadmap? What’s the biggest ask?

GG: multi-threading going to be one of the biggest ask. Right now our customers are looking into Wasm from performance perspective. Whatever we do on JS, single-threaded. Making things multi-threaded will give a lot of ground to innovate. That’s probably somewhere in the roadmap. That’s one of the things that our customers will think of.

CW: this is specifically multi-threading with GC references, right? Are they looking at closed-world compilation, or something more compositional?

GG: don’t know the answer to that. Generally the potential they are expecting. Are they willing to move completely into Wasm. For performance reason yea. If you think about general customer base, different.

FM: you mentioned about dynamic/deferred loading. There’s good and bad news here. Good news that it should be doable. Bad news is that we still haven’t solved the mutual recursion problem of modules. Java is heavily mutual recursive at the class level.

TL: what connection between deferred loading and mutual recursion? What’s the particular interaction that is special to GC perhaps?

FM: not special to GC. you want to partition your java code into pieces that can be loaded dynamically. So long as you can do it in a layered fashion, that’s an additional constraint on the partitioning, can’t have mutual recursion across module boundaries

GG: we haven’t investigate modules in general. Looks like you’ll need to recreate the type system in every module. Sounded like trying to bring a couple of binaries compiled together, want to refer to modules in the loading. Our apps are global optimized, we are looking for efficient way to deliver that app. We don’t have the problem of making types compatible, in our case there is one single type. The problem trying to be solved is different in our case. E.g. GMail, thousands of different individual JS code, incrementally loaded based on different strategies, tooling is automated to split it in a way into small pieces and incrementally loaded. Eventually one of the things we will need, but is different from problem of compatible types. We want lightweight (size-wise) loading, that we know globally before-hand.
