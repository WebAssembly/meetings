###  Announcement: TC39 incubator call (Asumu Takikawa, 5 min)

AT: Thursday 23rd at 9 pacific. Intent to talk about Wasm and JS interop. Dan Ehrenberg will be presenting. Will not be specific to GC.

###  Discussion: AOT compilation experiments (Ross Tate, 15 min)

Slides: [(pdf)](presentations/2021-09-21-tate-experiments-with-aot-compilation.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-09-21-tate-experiments-with-aot-compilation.pptx)

RT: Context is work on gradual typing. Have three benchmarks. AOT performs as well as JVM and Node on classes/objects benchmark. For short-lived objects, Racket’s GC makes it particularly fast and JVM’s speculative optimizations make it faster than everything else. Node is similar due to speculative optimizations. On float benchmark, packing floats has a large performance benefit over boxing floats. Takeaway is that AOT compilation of Java programs performs better than JS, so we should be able to see that Wasm GC performance match JS performance without advanced optimizations like Alon has been doing.

KM: What is the X-axis?

RT: Basically a continuum of source code typing between JS on the left and Java on right.

RT: We used call tags - basically how SpiderMonkey implements call_indirect - to handle bridging between typed and untyped code and for interface calls and lambdas and saw that it was faster than strategies implemented in other systems. Specifically call tags was just as fast as typed function pointers, so we hypothesize that using call tags instead of typed function references in WebAssembly would have the same performance but more expressiveness and flexibility.

###  Discussion: Separate compilation (Ross Tate, 30+ min)

Slides: [(pdf)](presentations/2021-09-21-separate-compilation-prioritization.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-09-21-separate-compilation-prioritization.pptx)

RT: Java modules are the unit of Java code that does not have recursion, which we’ve said we don’t want to support.

FM: What about mutual recursion between modules?

RT: I don’t believe Java supports mutual recursion.

TL: Where would you say the current proposal with the currently proposed type imports sits on this continuum?

RT: Seems to work out for splitting but not for Java modules.

BT: One weird thing I found is that in Java null is a bottom type but we don’t have a bottom type in Wasm. When you translate Java bytecode to Wasm, you need to compute where the nulls are going so you can add a (possibly imported) type.

AT: For “no separate compilation” slide, might you still need to import types defined in JS?

RT: I’m assuming that you would use a declarative custom section for interop rather than declaring types in JS.

KM: What about DOM integration? Could import type layout for fast access.

RT: If you’re importing the layout of engine-defined types, you’re exposing and standardizing engines’ internal representations. Need some sort of offset translation to keep that layout private.

BT: What are your thoughts on what to do about initializing objects/v-tables whose layout is defined across modules? Importing a struct with a vtable as its first reference requires it to be immutable to get depth subtyping for example.

RT: There are a number of solutions that we should talk about as a group. Can treat vtables specially to get the required subtyping, for example.

DE (chat): yeah agree that initializing things is hard and the current GC proposal doesn't handle the separate compilation of superclass/subclass for non-defaultable/immutable fields
I guess I figured that people had deemed that unimportant but this presentation gives reasons to doubt that

FM: What are the risks here?

RT: One risk is having redundant instructions, another is that we design ourselves into a corner and can’t add new things we want.

AK: What kind of work are you thinking of doing as a result of this conversation?

RT: Would design things differently if we know up front that we will want to eventually support separate compilation.

FM: You can have different compilation schemes or use different features if you (the compiler) know you are or are not doing separate compilation.

FM: Another way to look at it is to ask what communities are unlocking. If we’re heading toward supporting no separate compilation, what communities does that block?

AK: We have not seen that the teams we’re working with have needed separate compilation and separate distribution. We’ve talked about modularity, but mostly for development time so the requirements are completely different.

BT: We’re coming up from raw bytes to just barely having managed layout, so we should continue climbing up this ladder of expressiveness. We should anticipate that we might have field accessors in the future.

SK: Would be great for MVP to not block separate compilation, but I don’t think kotlin needs separate compilation now.

ASC: For dart, we’re most interested in deferred loading of some parts in a whole-program compilation setting. Also interested in modular builds where the compiler still sees the whole program.

BT: Is the splitting you’re talking about e.g. using a separate standard library or is it a custom splitting?

ASC: For the former, was thinking of a custom splitting.

DE: Can circle back to tools people in Igalia to see what they need. Also wondering how this would affect the JS interop story. If we think about separate compilation at all, there are plenty of other strategies like using numeric indices instead of separate vtables or using RTT-based dispatch. Don’t want to go back to the drawing board, but there’s a lot we could strip away.

AK (chat): +1, As someone who spoke up, I don't want my saying "I don't think we need to support Java modules for the MVP" imply "please remove type imports"

TL: So far no one has spoken up with a requirement for separate compilation beyond splitting or parallel building + whole-program linking.

FM: This is really about what the application developers need, not just toolchain developers. Adam’s point was salient because he speaks for large Wasm application developers.

BT: I was also looking at IT and want to make sure IT can be lowered to GC types, so it can implement separate shared-nothing IT modules at least.

FM: Yes, that’s certainly the plan. The IT question here is whether separate modules cross ownership boundaries.

BT: It came up that Luke Wagner is working on a suite of new stream types, which is similar to generics.

FM: Not a goal to let folks “define their own types” in IT.

TL: At time and no one has expressed a concrete requirement for separate compilation, so I would lean toward not focusing on that right now for continued work, Ross.
