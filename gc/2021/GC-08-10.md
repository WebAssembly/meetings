### Taming type recursion (Andreas Rossberg)

AR: Presenting [slides](presentations/2021-08-10-rossberg-taming-recursion.pdf)

RT: can you explain why antisymmetry property is not important?

AR: Antisymmetry means if you have two types that are both subtypes of each other, they are equivalent. That property is not actually needed for anything, not what you rely on in practise, and does not hold in all subtype systems.

BT: which equivalent is this $t == $u here?

AR: structural isorecursive equivalence.

AR: it is nominal except you do everything up to structural equivalence.

BT: only one supertype?

AR: will get to that

ZB (chat): Do we still need RTTs in this case?

RT (chat): you still need something to cast with

ZB (chat): Can’t we use type for that?

RT (chat): it'd replace a constant-time run-time subtyping check with a super-linear subtyping check

BT: that is a choice whether you want engine to enforce if multiple supertype constraints can be satisfied, can make a case where you don’t want engine to check that

AR: You need to check it because you might use it in one of your instructions - example: You have two supertypes that make contrary assumptions about the type of a field and then you access that field, what type do you get? I don’t think you can allow inconsistent supertypes. There may be ways around that problem, not sure if we need to solve it for MVP

RT: don’t think anyone has currently implemented RTT according to current spec

AR: there is an expected technique, separate problem, the idea is like the Java style vector of supertypes

CW: The part that AR is talking about is the part of RTT mechanism that has already been implemented. Not recursive canonicalization

[end of presentation]

BT: does this get rid of the need for recursion groups?

AR: you still have recursion groups, that’s what type equivalence is based on. Degenerate case: one recursion group for the whole module, then it's indistinguishable from nominal. Except that if you have recursion groups defined in multiple modules, you can still merge/link these modules without having unique type definitions. Usually you only want recursion group span a minimum number of types

FM: what about private fields?

AR: talking about an assembly language

FM: you still need to prevent accesses to structure, otherwise you get the same problem that BT outlined, language can’t implement the constraints, a purely nominal system will allow you to model this, since all the subtype relations are explicit

DE: aren’t private fields going to be implemented by type imports proposal that has an encapsulation mechanism?

AR: yeah..

RT: That doesn’t implement private fields, have to dynamically wrap objects, don’t have direct access to private fields, everything has to go through a layer of indirection

DE: yea but maybe that’s acceptable, my understanding is that’s how encapsulation is supposed to work in the current design. Not sure if people are working on type imports or that part, or if there is interest in other approaches to privacy

AR: We have to be careful not to conflate multiple issues. GC types are a replacement for linear memory, there are no private fields in linear memory. The main use case for encapsulation is where you want to pass an object to untrusted functions, from other language runtimes, this is in the realm of interface types. That is what the private types feature in the import types proposal tries to support. We’ve agreed that running against incomplete types is out of scope for MVP two meetings ago

RT: in the JS world, they have private fields, so you can give your objects to other modules without them tinkering with it

AR: That is a source level language, we’re talking about an assembly language, different problems

RT: think people want Wasm objects to go to JS space and not be able to have untrusted modules tinker with private fields

AR: You’re in the cross-language realm where you could use private types 

CW: separate question of how JS views Wasm objects. Maybe a JS mechanism to mark part of Wasm object as private

BT: This has a tendency to explode into various paths, this is an implementation level pass will not be able to expose source level details. 

DE (chat): ​​I don't really understand how this group decided on Andreas's hierarchy of goals. I think private fields is probably more important than being able to link modules in different languages without having a support module that coordinates things. (structural typing is also a bunch of twisty passages, as we've learned...)
I'd like to come back to the question of the Wasm GC JS API as well

RT: don’t think you have to add mechanism to support this…

AK: unlikely to resolve this here, clear that this doesn’t support private fields

AR: Yes. Not a goal of the proposal.

CW: Add one more sentence - we should explicitly have a discussion about private fields and whether they are in scope.

LW: will be good to know if that's the only remaining open issue

CW: One of the many things people have conflicting opinions about, can be teased apart in the future.

AR: have tried to make clear on every occasion that this type system is an assembly level representation of data layout, that’s the role. You can come up with many additional requirements, but that’s not the declared goal of the proposal.

RT: Let’s move on.

RT: For the slides that you have right now, nominal types modulo canonicalization, what languages would benefit from that?

AR: if you compile structural types into that, you still have structural equivalence, so basically all languages that have those, which is almost all languages, as long as you want to do something else than just whole program compilation or linking

BT: One implication is you get the advantages of nominal subtypes but don’t have the canonicalization problem where you have to import all the types..

LW: when we did call_indirect, discussed the question of multiple modules and call_indirect, should we treat as structural, or should we require unique def for all other modules to import, we didn’t have to think about recursion. Decided that it will be easier for toolchain if you don’t have to worry about that, so use structural equivalence. Only thing new with this is worrying about recursion without being expensive. If this idea solves recursion problem, then the same rationale that leds to structural func sigs would lead to the same here.

RT: The issue has the iso recursion problems - two groups that have the same recursion groups but different order.

LW: yea so we can look if does it solve the problems, if there are no problems this is the default choice since we do it for func types. Nice for toolchain.

RT: If those modules made their recursion groups in different ways they wont be linkable.

LW: have to see if recursion has problem in practice, if not, it will help out the toolchain

AR: A producer has to make sure that the type definitions it produces are canonical in certain ways, for example always picks a consistent order - also true for fields. Producer may want to reorder but needs to make sure it does so consistently. When you want to link things together type defs you usually link modules that come from the same producer, that is the use case. 

FM: thank you to AR for the creative solution



### Minimal delta for evaluating nominal types (Ben Titzer)

BT: we have had lots of disagreement about particular flavor of the type system, around structural v.s. Nominal types. Amount of effort everyone has put into discussion is not commensurate with outcome, we are not empirical enough. Most progress we made recently is due to people implementing things, trying things out, measuring them. TL and others implementing canon of equi-recursive types discovered it was a performance problem. Issue #234 (https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/234), to implement delta on top of current proposal which adds nominal types. Should evaluate nominal types in all seriousness. Add smallest possible delta to proposal, they go through all toolchain, spec interp, in vm. These are implemented, rogue actions to see if nominal types solve the problem. Will be great if those are not side experiments but are serious things in our repo. Don’t think the delta is big, given what AR proposed today, it is even smaller. It’s a contingency plan, if this iteration of structural types doesn’t solve the problem, and if we have also done nominal types, we are not screwed. Nominal types is a backup plan. JVM has nominal type, it works. Having a backup plan is valuable. If they are implemented in the same system, we can do side-by-side comparison, whether in V8 or ref interp, makes our arguments empirical. Write a wat can run them to see perf difference. One implication of using nominal types is that we can get rid of RTT and make it implicit, you can test that, implement in V8, and measure it.

AR: More like an orthogonal thing, RTT is for forward compatibility with adding generics in a way that doesn’t suck

BT: if someone proposes that nominal types can be better for a reason, onus on them to show so. This requires work to prove that what is proposed is actually better.

BT: We shouldn’t commit to a particular approach, we should implement the union, and everyone should be opk with whatever the empirical evaluation comes up with. I don’t think all of those outcomes are equally likely, if we can evaluate that in an objective way that gives us a way forward. We have to face up to the fact that people will generate code for this - if it turns out that some producers work better with nominal types, to be honest about how usable it is, we have to implement it. “Pay as you go” requirement, we can evaluate this. We can’t do that if are not able to implement nominal types, I have a view, but we must do due diligence.

FM: agree that having implementations changes the conversation, however it costs money to develop these proposals, a nominal type system. If talking about V8, it’s a disproportionate burden on Google. If we can do this on a lighter weight implementation, it will be easier for people to develop alternatives, and maybe easier to compare and contrast. Signal from changing reference interp might not be accurate.

BT: agree it is work, compared to the work that might occur if we don’t have that, the mental effort arguing about things that can't reach resolution, is an opportunity cost. Jakob probably implemented most of this.

AK: JK mic is not working

DE: excited about V8’s implementation, agree that unfair if all the burden went to Google. Igalia working on doing what it can, this is mostly in terms of related proposals, like typed func refs or exception handling. Want to raise attention to JS API. V8 team presented interesting approach to Wasm GC JS API, nominal v.s. Strutural questions has implication for the form of this API. In particular the V8 team used RTT for this, maybe types can be used, maybe it affects previous point about what’s in custom section v.s. Instruction. Will be good to collectively marshall resources to prototype or design different approaches to JS API, to enable usage without as many expensive wrappers, to see how nominal v.s. Structural affects all that.

JK: We have not implemented everything yet, don’t have full implementation of structural types, have not done the work for iso recursive types, relying on binaryen for nominal types, willing to implement more as long as it’s reasonable.

RT: a lot of stuff has been at the validation level, doesn’t affect the runtime or GC besides things like RTT possibly. Will reduce the amount that it will cost people.

KM: For some platforms, the validation is a part of the runtime, you have to validate it when you receive the data

CW: about where the engineering effort goes, if nominal v.s. Structural is just validation then no need to do 2 end-to-end. STrongly second BT’s point, however much time we spend prototype, we will waste less time than years of discussion with nothing to show.

<KM agrees>

AR: One question is how do you want to evaluate them? Outcome: Java implementation is ncier/faster, but ignores other sets of use cases. How much onus is on the people advocating for these approaches? 

BT: good question, don’t have complete answer. Still a bit of disagreement about the requirements as stated. Will need to discuss what is a fair evaluation. What J2CL team is doing, their feedback is something we should account for. Not something we can just write our own programs and benchmarks. Requires interfacing with groups trying to use this.

RT: We had someone working on targeting ocaml. Haven’t seen them for some time, same with haskell

AK: part of prototyping is to figure out the criteria. Requirements around performing better than JS, validation mentioned by KM as something we care about. In general, performance is what is important for MVP.

AR: performance of what? In early days of Wasm, a strong C++ bias on the group. We were fairly successful not baking in too much or any C++ bias. Currently see a heavy Java bias, probably a greater risk than earlier. My question is how to avoid falling into that trap, and building something that is essentially a Java type system that only serves Java well. We need a good answer to this beforehand before we do all the work experimenting, then disagree on evaluation.

CW: That’s too high a bar to start experimentation 

BT: the languages that really want to come to Wasm GC are all Java like, we designed structural type system that we believe is more general, maybe it is not even needed. Realistically, we have to look at use cases that are coming and design for that. If we implement a nominal types thing, then we can say we try to implement things for Java well.

AR: how to avoid falling into Java trap, at its heart it is a dynamic language. Might be tempted to take shortcuts that only work for Java.

BT: Not sure I agree that Java is as dynamic as you think, different conversation. How do we evaluate it? 

FM: our true competition is JS, someone has to implement the X to Wasm compiler, probably also has a to JS compiler. If Wasm is slower than JS, Wasm won’t win.

CW: IT would be horrifying if some version didn’t beat JS or OCaml for example

FM: ideally for all languages that need garbage collection

AK: some interest in this approach, and requirements for how to measure this.

BT: have discussion on issue, people can weigh in, next meeting we can have a poll.

TS (chat): There are a lot of functional languages for the web, compiling to JavaScript. PureScript, Elm, Gleam. Maybe ask in those communities?

CW (chat):I think as a compilation target, it makes sense to think of it as a competitor, somewhat separate to smoothness of interop

DE (chat): Yes, that's a good case to validate this approach: those will only work well if the Wasm GC/JS API works well
