### Presentation: Equirecursive Types in Binaryen [Thomas Lively] (1 hr)

FM: if you do this as two separate calls to TypeBuilder, you should still get the two types are equal.

TL: yes, in this case you can’t construct A and B separately.

FM: if you did this again, if you did it for C and D, they should be equal.

TL: yes, it should be globally canonical across all TypeBuilders. Also, if we have a different form, if one of these were unfolded, if they gave us the same type structure, they would also be equivalent, even if the definition didn’t look the same.

CW: Future slide about how type declarations are related to nodes in the graph?

TL: yes (slide on HeapTypes as DFAs)

FM: can you explain why you make i32 an accepting state?

TL: accepting and not accepting doesn’t actually matter, because we are not actually doing a DFA. classic DFA has accepting and non-accepting states. I32 and f32 being different leaf types will be different final states, and will be distinguished in the initial partitioning. If you have two types taking the same path, one goes to i32 another to f32, then those are different types, hopcroft algorithm will end up separating them

FM: the language here is accessors to the type

KM: Would A & B in any dfa minimization be the same here?

TL: they will not, hopcroft works via partition refinement, the partitions will be split up, never merging. By virtue of starting out in different starting partitions, A and B will remain distinct forever.

KM: How are initial partitions decided?

TL: you go through each heap type, calculate a hash of the top level structure, up to but not including children, put in a hashmap. If you hash but it is already in there, you append it to the partition you created for that top level structure. If two types have the same top level structure, they hash and compare the same, will be put in the same partition.

RT: This is node-labelled dfa. If you think of accepting v.s. non-accepting, generalizing to shape labels.

FM: hopcroft algorithm would have started with two partitions.

RT: you generalize it, rather than label being accepting, now the label is the shape

KM: when you say top level structure, that’s with all the names of the things you reference to removed?

TL: yup

FM: if you are only looking at the top level, suppose that top level has struct by inclusion, not by reference

TL: not possible in the MVP, we would have to update the scheme for inline structs like that

FM: n^2 of what?

TL: n^2 in number of distinct types defined in the type section. We would have deduplicated any types, but maybe there were no duplicates. We have as many heap types as there were in the heap type section, which can refer to each other. The structure for each type could be the size of entire graph

RT: how do you compute the hash?

TL: same as before, with top-level to false. For each node, remember the index, if we hash again to that index.

RT: dynamically create ordering of vertices, then making sure you don’t walk it?

TL: in code, if we see heap type, then hash index if we saw it, without recursing into it

FM: that algo itself may be n^2 or something nasty, because every type in the tree you have to see if you already encountered it, it’s not linear in structure

TL: we use a hash map, the key to the hashmap is a heap type, not heap type info. Key-ing into hash is constant, since we are using the id. Originally, I did it wrong, using de bruijn indices, so you never recurse into the same time on the same paths, but possible from different paths. It took a long time for hashing to complete. n^2 at best.

CW: would canonicalization be done at compile or instantiation time in engine?

RT: instantiation time after all imports provided

CW: purely because of abstract type imports

RT: type imports specifically, have to compute all rtt canons, at instantiation time. A subset can be done at compile time, it depends.

LW (chat): I think a subset of the type graph can be done at compile time (that isn't dependent on type imports)

CW: we discussed neutering structural abstract type imports, not sure if we went further

RT: post-mvp would have you do this at runtime.

TL: some post-mvp where you get the type parameterization and create new rtts at runtime. Doing type canon on those would require you to do this at runtime.
