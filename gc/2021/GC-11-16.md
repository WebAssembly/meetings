### Discussion: Relationship between externref and anyref (20 minutes)

FM: What is externref for?

AR: It is the fallout of removing subtyping in reference types proposal. From my perspective, it is a stopgap measure that should never be used once we have anyref. Only anyref gives complete flexibility for how types are implemented, e.g. in Wasm or by the host.

TL: From that point of view, could just rename externref to anyref and re-merge them.

AR: Drawbacks are renaming and that we might in the future have new types that can’t be used externally. But I admit this is hypothetical and possibly a weak reason.

JK (chat): as I said on GitHub, I don't understand how externref allows us to build the kind of restriction Andreas just mentioned.

FM: If you assume that externref is the type of things that don’t belong to you, you just leave it at that and don’t pretend it has anything to do with other WebAssembly types. But then you might want to implement externref in one module with some Wasm type in another module.

AR: It makes sense that it should be an abstract type, but I think anyref should be that abstract type.

ZB: In some languages we would need to box more. For example when putting a DOM node in a collection, we would like to not box. 

TL: It will be great to get those experimental results.

RT: My understanding is that externref is for JS types, and I don’t think that requires changes. The GC overview says it will be used parametric polymorphism, but it is not being used like that.

AR: After I wrote that, I realized that for my compilers eqref is sufficient for the polymorphism.

ZB: It would be useful to be able to compare anyrefs as well.

TL: So make eqref the top type?

AR: Maybe eq should be an attribute on types rather than its own type. Should be simple. Main drawback is an extra bit to consider.

RT: Or you could make externref a subtype of eqref.

BT: I want to see the experiments, but I don’t want to commit Zalim to too much work. It shouldn’t be too hard to write benchmarks.

RT: Right now the problem is that Kotlin generally isn’t very fast.

BT: We could write microbenchmarks in the text format to get around that.

ZB: We need to find a more real-world micro and macro benchmarks.

TL: Ben, would you be interested in looking at the microbenchmarking?

BT: I have other priorities, but my main point is that I don’t think we should block on Kotlin becoming fast.

TL: There are so many options here that I don’t think it even makes sense to do a non-binding poll on what we think we should do right now. Let's pick this discussion back up once we have more implementer feedback on what would be useful.

### Presentation: Waml (Andreas Rossberg, 40 minutes)

[slides](presentations/2021-11-16-rossberg-wob+waml.pdf)

FM: Curious about the force operators about thunks?

AR: Maybe that’s an SML-NJ extension? I think that’s just frontend sugar, so not too interesting. Unlike in Haskell, which would be a whole different experience.

RT: Some time ago we shared this currying strategy with some OCaml people and they were worried about all the casts necessary in that strategy.

AR: Yes, I will get back to that. In general functional languages need much more casting in the current proposal, but it’s good that at least we can get the languages working at all.

RT: Interface calls are similarly bad to currying because you also have to cast the interface table.

AR: That’s probably right.

BT: Is there a way to use func.bind here?

AR: Maybe, I haven’t tried. Functors should work, but I’m not sure it matters much.

BT: An advantage of func.bind is that there is one less cast.

FM: We were looking at func.bind for IT and there some insurmountable problems with it having to do with lifetimes.

AR: I would expect it to be hard to use outside of a GC context.

LW: FWIW, func.bind was a huge monkey wrench ABI-wise when I was implementing it in SpiderMonkey. At least if we keep it, it would be great to not have it return a funcref.

BT: Virgil also has similar features, but some extra generality makes func.bind unsuitable there, too.

BT: About the new null type, are you suggesting a new instruction?

AR: Or just a new type to pass as the immediate to existing ref.null.

TL: Another option is to spec existing ref.null to ignore its immediate.

AR: True, but ugly.
