### Presentation: Update on spec interpreter [Andreas Rossberg]

AR Presenting [slides](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/gc/2021/presentations/2021-03-09-rossberg-update-wob.pdf)

AR demonstrating [Wob interpreter](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/tree/wob/proposals/gc/wob)

Strings loaded into memory then copied byte-by-byte into array
Arrays, tuples, generics work.
Only boxed types allowed for generics because it’s the simplest thing. Want to explore further.
Need to do ref.as_data then ref.cast to get from any to concrete struct. Ref.as_data doesn’t support null, so a null check is necessary as well. Slightly painful.
Classes represented by 5-tuples. Vtable, constructor, pre- and post-allocation hooks, pointer to superclass. Need hooks to get 2-phase initialization of immutable data.

ZB: Does this language have non-nullable types?

AR: Right now it uses nullable types in most places. Non-nullable locals become useless if you don’t have locals of that type. Wob uses non-nullable locals only in vtable and class definitions.

FM: This example maps strings to array of mutable i8s?

AR: Yes, to make initialization possible.

FM: We’ve been talking about sealing or marking things read-only after initialization.

AR: Agree.

FP: What would a sealing capability give you as a client of this? Can see it would be useful in the source language.

AR: One important thing is subtype, if source lang has immutable field on which you allows subtype, you can only map to Wasm if you map to read-only fields. If they are immutable then you can’t initialize them. If you have a read-only mode, a super type of both mutable and immutable, you can allocate something as mutable, it is not subtypable in contents type, but subtypable in its mode. If you forget it’s mutable, you can also subtype its contents.

CW: Would that require an affine type to ensure there’s not another mutable reference hanging around?

AR: read-only is not immutable, it wouldn’t matter for soundness, would be different from immutable, cannot write it, but can be changed by someone else with a more precise type. That’s sound on the Wasm level.

TL: question about spec interp, for rtt.canon, what algo do you use to canonicalize all the types? 

AR:The ref interp doesn’t canonicalize anything, doesn’t have to, does the graph traversal algorithm each time, kind of like the declarative specification.

TL: if i have two equivalent but different declarations of equirecursive types, they need to get the same rtt.canon, how does it determine those two get the same rtt value.

AR: it doesn’t, it ends up being equivalent rtt values. It puts in whatever you wrote, when it compares rtt it does the right comparison. It is not the implementation you would want to use in the engine, for ref interp that’s the canonical thing you want to do.

BT: we have limited set of init instructions which are blessed, whats you’re thinking on allocating/writing to array, so you can describe initialization of arrays.

AR: what do you mean by initialization?

BT: e.g. for globals, you can read from another global. If we expand that to include object allocation, writing fields, we can have object literals.

AR: I agree that we want to do that. Especially for allocating rtts, but also i31, structs, and arrays. Anything without observable side effects should be fine.

BT: another question about array, i foresee in the future people will want to mix i/o with array and memory as well. Should we consider instruction that do bulk copies or make array look like memories, or first class memories.

AR: probably want some more low-level instructions over arrays that are byte arrays. Maybe first class memories are a way? Would expect that to be a separate concept, presumably more heavyweight. From the string init example, sort of stupid to copy byte by byte in a loop. Can unroll. Probably want to extend it. Might want to restrict it to some degree, so that the engine has leeway how it lays out its struct/array internally. For pure byte array like i8, can probably make exceptions and say it is always packed densely, so we can convert to other types, e.g. all the numeric types always pack densely. Not needed for MVP, more of a performance thing.

CW: Would it make sense to implement the efficient canonicalization algorithm in the interpreter as a reference for other implementors.

AR: yea… the interpreter doesn’t implement anything efficiently at all, could definitely write an implementation.

CW: i just mean efficient in the sense that different from the graph traversal each time comparing rtt

AR: wants to do the declarative thing, follow the spec, which is the graph traversal. There is nothing stopping us from writing and impl and playing with it. Maybe there are ways to avoid this graph canonicalization and reduce it to just tree normalization, which will be hash consing if we do it the right way. That’s a separate discussion.

TL: that will be useful discussion to have sooner rather than later, currently in Binaryen, reducing Binaryen functionality rather than implementing the canonicalization of type. Binaryen used to calculate LUB of everything, taking that out because it is too complex

AR: been on my plate for a while, want to get back to it soon.

RT: separate compilation working? You have to know all the internals of C?

AR: you don’t need to know, will show an example of that.

RT: doesn’t have class inheritance across modules?

AR: that works, one reason why i package the class up as a tuple, only import and export the tuple, gives me everything i need

RT: doesn’t that tell you all the internals of the classes?

AR: yes, in C++ you depend on the layout of class, if you change it you have to recompile your deps.

AR: I would also like to try a different representation strategy for classes that doesn’t require recompilation.

FM: speak a little bit about making classes themselves typed and not nominal?

AR: classes are nominal in the language

FM: in the wasm representation as well?

AR: no, that’s not necessary. That’s a separate problem. Right now there are no casts, it’s only a static type check. For casts, whether the Wasm is nominal or not, you can’t use Wasm rtt to represent source language casts. Either they are too weak, if all rtt are structural. Or if rtt are nominal, they are too strong. Neither works to implement source semantics. You have to implement type representation for these casts in userspace. That is the case until we have Wasm generics themselves.

CW: this is about C#, languages with proper generics?

AR: yea. In interpreter you have fully reified generics, polymorhpic recursion, etc. The Java thing is not what you want by design, what they got out of historic accident. 

CW: not the semantics that is most challenging to support, but have to compile to Wasm.

AK (chat): I'm curious about your statement that MVP is about expressiveness, not performance; we've talked about how "performing better than JS" is a pretty important feature, at least in Web embeddings.

AR: yea it should still be somewhat better than JS, if you can’t even compile stuff, then performance won’t help. First thing we have to validate is to compile stuff. Then worry about performance. Agree that mvp should be on par with JS or better. Positive that it will be. This runs using ref interpreter, so wont help with performance. The Wasm module that it generates should run in any engine that supports the proposal. You can observe using return export, or assertions.
