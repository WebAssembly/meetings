BS: No agenda today. Any comments?

SR: (chat) Is it still possible to attend the WG meetings as a CG member?

BS: Yes, please contact me and I'll add you to the calendar invitation.

BS: Just a FYI, Dan Ehrenberg mentioned that Igalia would like to host the next
in-person meeting in Barcelona. Nothing finalized yet, so if you have any
concerns please contact me.

RW: What's the status of host bindings?

LW: Is it in terms of WebIDL types... Adam K is checking on things and will
respond to me.

AK: Yeah, still need to look into some stuff. I'll get back to you on that.

LW: In the meantime, landing reference type stuff. A prereq for this.

BT: We're also working on ref types, hoping to be done this month.
