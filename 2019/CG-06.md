## Logistics

* [A Coruña airport (LCG)](http://www.aena.es/en/a-coruna-airport/airport-destinations.html) is connected to Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, London/Heathrow.

   * Taxi costs ~20€ to the center.
   * The Airport-City Center Bus line (Line 4051 Centro da cidade - Aeroporto) last stop is the Bus Station (in Spanish: Estación de autobuses). 

* Other airports that could be used to get to Coruña:

   * [Santiago de Compostela (SCQ)](http://www.aena.es/en/santiago-airport/airport-destinations.html) is about 50km from Coruña, still a good option if you have a direct flight from Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Zurich, Frankfurt, Geneva, Milán, París or Rome. Trains from Santiago train station to A Coruña last ~30 minutes.
   * [Porto Airport (OPO)](https://www.ana.pt/en/opo/flights-destinations/destinations/destinations-map) is well conected with more international airports but it is 3h by car from A Coruña or a longer bus/train trip. It could be a potential option if you have a direct flight from North America (NY, Toronto, Montreal) or Brazil (Rio / Sao Paulo).
