BS: Follow up on License for wasi-sysroot. I spoke w/ Eric, our W3 coordinator.
He has looped in some lawyers and others who can answer the question, but we
haven't heard back from the lawyers yet. When I last talked to Dan he said we
may move a different direction, not having to land this under the wasm repo in
the first place.

DG: We're fine doing that, if it makes things simpler.

BS: We'll still want to get this figured out with legal.

DG: It kind of puts it in the same camp as binaryen or wabt.

LI: If we keep the code in the repo by itself. The GH UI will use the musl
stuff that was merged by itself. This might help since it shows MIT.

DG: Not all of it is MIT, there are other licenses too.

LI: How does GitHub UI show the license?

DG: Doesn't show a particular license, just links to the text file.

LI: We could bring this up at GH office hours, to display the other licenses.

BS: That would help, but I think there are other concerns here too.
