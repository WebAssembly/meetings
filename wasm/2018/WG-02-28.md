### Adoption of the agenda

JF Seconds.

### Discussion on the process of branching + Working Drafts.
       * Do we accumulate all master changes into the next Working Draft?
       * When do we start new REC trains?
       * Context: https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/714

Discussion on versions, keeping several versions in flight.
When to hand the w3c new drafts.
Do we want to take new features?
What about non-trapping conversions?

Andreas: We should not let new features creep in.

Luke: For now we do the cherry-picking, but later it will be more mechanical.

Andreas: I'm not aware of any that are ready to be merged.

*Discussion*

Vague consensus is we treat v1 specially, we only land editorial / mvp fixes.
We'll sort out later when to start a v2 train.

### Discussion on status of the Working Draft.
       * Appeal for more chapter [reviewers](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5Bspec+review%5D+label%3Aeditorial)

Got a few more owners for various chapters.

Discussion: Useful to have more exhaustive tests.

Luke: Core spec we've been assuming it's fairly good.

JF: Not in the test262 sense. I don't think we want to gate anything on it, not sure we want to block on it.

Andreas: The way the test suite is structured, there's mostly one file for each construct. There's some earlier tests that don't quite fit into that scheme. Within a single file it's hard to tell what any one test tests.

JF: Should we ask Dan?

Luke: Initially Dan is on the hook for JS + Web spec.

AI: bradnelson: open issue on making tests comprehensive.
