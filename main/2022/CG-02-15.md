### Proposals and discussions

#### Advance GC to phase 2 (Thomas Lively)

TL Presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RgdF3_QPV8jcZXl4PIl0HRlG38mzhdM_cFWKZDJyN8Y/edit?usp=sharing)

TL: Agreement on the type system is the one that’s inspired a year of debate and prototyping. It’s by far the biggest issue we’ve tackled. For this proposal, agreement on the type system should be the bar for the definition of phase 2 requirement

AK: What systems were those numbers from? In what codebase?

TL: J2CL module, on the left the optimized version of the module, on the right same module without optimization measurements come from doing canonicalization/ type building and validation in Binaryen

OC: <in chat> where does the 24k types number comes from?

TL: The optimized Java module, not sure what it does but it is a real world Java program that was compiled. optimized module was 10Mb 

AZ: the module was mostly runtime code required for a bunch of different benchmarks.



**POLL** GC proposal to Phase 2:

* SF: 21
* F: 11
* N: 5
* A: 0
* SA: 0
