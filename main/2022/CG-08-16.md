### Announcement: Welcome Conrad Watt as the new co-chair of the CG

Excited to bring Conrad Watt on as a new CG co-chair!

Research fellow in University of Cambridge, interested in finding ways to nudge procedural inefficiencies that have held us back. 

Mozilla and Microsoft financially supporting work - thanks to Bobby Holley (Mozilla) and Ralph Squillace and Karen Chu (Microsoft)

I’ll specifically be working on advancing the Threads proposal.

### Announcement: In-person (with virtual attendance options) CG meeting in San Francisco, tentative dates are 10/26/2022, 10/27/2022

Google will be sponsoring, hosting in San Francisco. Meeting will be hybrid, with virtual options. Google’s policy requires anyone coming to the office to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Format will be similar to previous meetings. Also we’d like to have an onboarding type session for new attendees. If you have other ideas for things to add, please give us feedback. We’d also like to solicit new hosts for future meetings.

### Quick update and discussion on interval primitives (Kloud Koder)[20 mins]

KK: It’s been 14 months, would like to put it in front of the group and see if we can get a decision. Interval arithmetic from e.g. engineering, simulations. The question from 14 months ago was not “is this useful in engineering” but are there sufficiently native functionality that we want to expose directly in wasm in new opcodes but something programmers or libraries should handle. 

So there were 2 questions: 

What performance penalty do you get under native Wasm? Is there a way to condense that into something that gives you accurate intervals, e.g. the max upper and lower bounds. Is there a way to use existing rounding modes? You can, but what is the penalty? 
(see discussion at https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1456)


I came up with a few ways of doing this, and with contributions from others. The bottom line is that in most cases, 99.9% of computations, you can take some shortcuts and do this well, with maybe a 50% penalty. But you’re always left with corner cases that are very expensive to resolve. 

When signs get involved, some of the comparisons need to be inverted, two way to do intervals, take the raw result, and add/subtract a margin, and it can be within a certain margin. You have to check for sign changes, denormals, potentially infinities. You could assume that you never hit these cases, just use a conditional move to keep track of the min/max, but only do something different when you hit denormals, but that also doesn’t work, because in some cases is 100% penalty.

So the bottom line is tha you and up with hundreds of perent penalties. So my understanding is that we’ve introduced other opcodes for smaller gains. So =I’d like to get consensus for one of 3 things:


We just won’t do this
We will, and I’ll leave it to you, the experts
I’ll end up doing most of the work


It took so long because I wanted an answer from NVIDIA, FP opcodes themselves have rounding modes, and this makes intervals really easy. NVIDIA has of course made their own compilers, e.g. C for CUDA. Are they doing this for wasm? If its’ on their roadmap then maybe we’ll get it for free. They want to push performance from their GPU on wasm, etc. But I wanted to get an answer. But they see wasm along with browsers, it’s more of a toy and not interesting for distributed computing. So they aren’t interested.

CW: Is the ideal world that thre is some instruction sequence in Intel/ARM that we can expose in Wasm that makes this very fast?

KK: definitely. And not even SIMD. even x87 you can do this. YOu load the control word with a rounding mode init, then you do your instructions, and it uses that rounding mode.So you can load the control word before each instruction (and then optimize). Most of the time you can stay in your default mode.

CW: Do you want instructions thatcupport the rounding modes, or are specific to interval modes themselves? 

KK: Yeah i glazed over that. I think the minimal sweet spot has rounding mode flavors of all the FP instructions. So if you just want nearest/even it’s the same. But if you want round toward neg inf, there’s an e.g. add opcode that gives you that rounding mode. IMO, well designed processors do that.

DG: performance penalty for this kind of thing on existing CPUs, e.g. Intel/ARM?

KK: It’s several times. Maybe on the order of 5-10x if you do/don’t have wasm opcodes where you can specify the rounding mode.


KK: I’d say penalty would be even worse on nvidia because you can’t load control word.

TL<chat>: What is the usual developer experience for performing calculations with interval arithmetic? Are there specific libraries, languages, or compiler features developers use?

KK: I’m not aware of all the libraries, some of them specifically use compiler intrinsics to manipulate the control word efficiently. 

CW: it does kind of sound like we could evaluate this similar to how we evaluated SIMD and it’s a question of what instructions would this be compiled to, how would it be compiled on various different architectures.

KK: This came up in the previous call, we could performance benchmark this, it became clear that to actually correctly emulate what intrinsic rounding modes do. It was 

CW: the main question then would be find some source that relies on the rounding mode, and we could go based on that use case

KK: USe something like interval library, and compare how fast a native library runs natively, and on Wasm.

CW: or.. If it relies on a rounding mode missing in wasm, it would be really slow

TL: it was very driven by particular libraries and use cases, the author came and said, this instruction is missing, here’s an example kernel, and showed how the performance was affected in the library. So we’d like to have the library authors do that here too.

DG: not necessarily. … if we do take a library and compile to wasm and get current numbers it can tell us what there is to gain. The other question is who is doing this. We need someone to champion the proposal and do the pre-work, find the minimal use case, find out how it behaves on native and the browser. It’s great to get the feedback loop when we have the baseline, and the concrete set of proposed instructions.

KK: makes sense. My concert would be that ifyou pick a low level library like C++ it would be using rounding mode intrinsics. But that wouldn’t compile to wasm and wouldn’t be a good comparison.

CW: Even a library that can’t target Wasm because we don’t support the rounding modes would be useful to have the feedback. A standard C++ Library that’s using compiler intrinsics, even that would be a good input into the process. There is some set of rounding control instructions that we could add to Wasm

KK: how would you compare it? If you had a proposal it would be different and faster

CW: We could still choose to implement them at the Wasm level, and we could use this to validate

KK: on x86 youd change the rounding control bits, on other platforms it would just pick different instructions.

CW: just for testing you could add a rounding control instruction for wasm.

TL: The library doesn’t say do this for this instruction, but the C global state of setting a rounding mode, sounds like we would have to modify the rounding modes, that won’t have the same performance benefits.

CW: if it was possible for the compiler to infer which mode to do, and do it dynamically as a fallback, then it could work

TL: true but that’s a lot more work than just e.g. putting out some compiler intrinsics in clang.

CW: Have a switch statement on the global state, and see how many of these can eliminate 

BT: what do these libraries do on RISCV which has static encoding?

KK: Don’t know much about RISCV

TL: what’s the name of one of these libraries?

KK: Peripherally familiar with this, you’d have to Google it. 

TL: I think the path forward is to find a specific library, figure out how it gets compared, and see what kind of compiler intrinsics they use, and pretty trivial to whip up some intrinsics. 

KK: Library that has these rounding modes, targeting the right CPU, and compile it to Wasm.

FM: Meta level issue, someone needs to champion it. It would involve driving this navigaiton

DG: to add to that, usually when there’s enough performance on the table, we can look at the numbers and the use ccases, and when that’s compelling enough, people jump in and implement and work on it. There are always 2 questions, one is whether it’s significant vs targeting niche use cases.

<Discussion about next steps>

FM: what really needs to happen is to take ownership of this in the CG. if you just raise an issue you won’t necessarily get much response. You have to bring the rest of it.

KK: Could do x86 library. 

KK: AFAIK there are libraries

CW: What’s the motivation to get interval primitives?

KK: I see wasm as future of distributed computing, could hold the future back for the lack of intervals

CW: so the test of whether they are critical would be finding the use case where we need the feature but it can’t work well today.

TL: Found the platform-specific details for boost::interval https://github.com/boostorg/interval/blob/develop/include/boost/numeric/interval/detail/x86gcc_rounding_control.hpp

KK: I’m not sure that any of these libraries can compile to Wasm. 

DS: Interpretation is not that we want to say we want to compile a specific library to Wasm, we would like to see a use case. A higher level use case - if you compile this to Wasm you can get this to Wasm you get this performance penalty, here is a proposal that can add this to functionality to Wasm. What is the best possible way to compile these to Wasm? The use case is more important than the details

CW1 <Chris Woods>: We might be able to help you with that, have some examples and can IM you with details.

DS: should we create a repo? Phase 0 proposal?


DG: We should have some specific use cases/libraries before we’re able to spin off a proposal

KK: the most famous use case was the superconducting supercolider where they proved it safe using intervals. I don’t know of more recent prominent use case. When I have my own itnerval needs I usually use an assembly language.

FM: Use case may be a little more specific, the case was presented very well in the beginning, i.e. wanting to know the precision of your answers what you would do as the champion is raising an issue, and finding data about performance, it’s more a good description of the problem you’re trying to solve, and how you’ll solve it.

KK do you mean specific implementation or real-world use cases for intervals?

FM: What is the change, why should that be changed, need to make a case for it. 

DS: Super conducting, super collider, when you use intervals you use them in your own program, you use assembly, even smaller use cases are important.

KK e.g. when you want to estimate roots, you want to see certain bounds on algebraic roots.

CW: that sounds like a good example of source code that you would want to see

KK: I guess so, yes

BT: is there anything beyond rounding mode that would benefit intervals, e.g. native instructions for intervals?

KK: Just on newer archs where you have embedded rounding mode controls

BT: but not like “interval add” or anything like that?

KK: Not to my knowledge.

KK: The rounding mode control affects all the instructions the same way so it’s not very flexible

DG: even so, it is something that we’ve had requests for.

TL<in chat>: Found the platform-specific details for boost::interval https://github.com/boostorg/interval/blob/develop/include/boost/numeric/interval/detail/x86gcc_rounding_control.hpp

DS: Do you feel like you have concrete next steps? 

KK: Yes, will file an issue with data, and library specifics. 

CW: Totally ok, if some of the motivating examples are your own code. The most helpful thing is something that already exists, but concocting code is also an option if needed

TL: I found the platform details for boost::interval (in chat). It does look like it’s based on control bits rather than instructions. It would be great even if we could find another library that supports the RISCV style of instructions. To get this one working on something with rounding mode built into the instructions we’d basically have to rewrite the whole thing

KK: Which platform is this library supposed to be compiled to? 

TL: this is boost so it targets mainstream platforms. It uses gcc bultins but doesn’t target any platform that bakes rounding mod einto instructions. So if we prototyped ar ounding control bit this would be easy to target to wasm, but if we do what you proposed (baking rounding mode into each instruction) then this library isn’t really compatible with that design.

CW: How bad would it really be if we were adding instructions with rounding modes, but emulate global state with software? 

TL: If we didn’t have to do that, if we just had a bunch of intrinsics, that’s easy in e.g. LLVM. if we had to do the switch-based thing, thats at least a couple weeks of throwaway work, it would be unlikely to happen.

BT: Switch based thing could be done in user code as well. 

TL: it would boil back down to a handful of intrinsics, I could help with that

CW: Switch would be emitted in Wasm, and Wasm level optimizations would eliminate the Switch

TL: but I did want to emphasize that we don’t need RISCV hardware to test a library that could target it.

KK: So all you’d have to do is implement several instructions, and there would be a switch statement around each instruction, and hopefully it could be optimized away?


TL: That is something that may be built into the boost interval library

CW: When you’re compiling the intrinsic, you can use a switch and that switch gets optimized away

JK<chat>: what I'd like to see is a motivating example that's more concrete than "someone in web3 might eventually need this". For _any_ feature: if it's important to add it to Wasm, then it should be possible to find someone in the world who says "I would use this for my app if it was available, and I'm willing to help with the design/exploration/prototyping".

KK:Willing to help with use case

CW: it was reassuring to hear that you do write code yourself that uses this, I do think that’s helpful.

KK: Hacks for research, not a “real library” 

BT: question about the in-person CG meeting? I’m looking forward to being there. I had previously thought about holding a wasm “research day” before an upcoming meeting. Is there interest in that?

DG: one of the things I dind’t say is we thought about having optional breakout rooms, there are several interesting tracks (e.g. WASI?). I’d be happy to follow up with ou on that more.

CW1, TL, KW, are interested.

FM: any ideas what we’ll be talking about in the face to face meeting?

DG: usually what we do is a bunch of proposal updates, e.g. ones we haven’t heard from in a while, we have a bunch with active subgroups we bring back to teh CG for wider discussion, phase advancements, early stage discussions, sometimes things that can be contentious, sometimes those are easier in person. Usaulaly peopel propose agenda items and we arrange it.

FM: thanks. Ben what did you have in mind for research?

BT: I’m interested in finding out what kind of research infrastructure people doing research need to help them with their work.

TL: IS the target audience a subset of the audience of the CG meeting? 

BT: I think an intersection of academics who may not want to go to a CG meeting, and also CG regulars who might be interested in research. So i’d invite academic researchers who might not otherwise come.

CW1<chat>: count me in for the research and in-person. Also as a new member I’m really interested in the onboarding/orientation session.

BH<chat>: Can we start a google doc or github issue to start collaborating?
