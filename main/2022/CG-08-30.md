###  Discuss reserved/illegal opcodes prefixes (issue)[https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1419] [10 mins]

DG: Several engines use 0xff opcodes for internal use. They are illegal now, but there was some appetite for a stronger assurance that it doesn’t get used in the future.

CW: there did seem to be at least some divergence. Thomas was saying we should still have the freedom to use ff if we run out of opcodes in the future, whereas some wanted assurance we’d never use it. Any decision we make now can of course be reversed in the future, but it would be good to see what people think.

RH: Our use case is generating Wasm bytecode for an asm.js module, the bytecode is internal to the engine, we just want to be able to reuse the decoder flag, we have runtime flag for the asm.js mode, we could still work around having a single opcode, reuse the single prefix for example. There could be other use cases where single bytecodes that BT  mentioned for instrumentation, for SpiderMonkey it’s not a big deal, we can add a non-normative note

DG: From V8 perspective, we also have these internal asm.js opcodes so we could probably also use a prefixed or 2 byte opcode as well.

BT: Conrad posted a link to JVM spec, theres a couple of paragraphs. I think I’d support something similar.

CW; I’m interested in hearing, is there anyone who would feel bad about us adopting the position now that we plan never to use the 0xff opcode?

RH: No concerns personally, between the single byte prefixed, and the last one there’s 36 single byte opcodes, having one of them be unallocated seems reasonable to me. 

TL: do we still think it’s important to have an escape hatch for the future if we run out of single byte opcode and need to do something? Currently that’s 0xff. If we say we’d never use it we regress that preparedness. Maybe it doesnt matter but, or want to address in a different way? eIther way, not urgent.

AR: I’m curious to understand the single opcode would make a big difference in that case, not hanging on one opcode when we run out makes more sense to me

TL: What we’d previously planned with 0xff was make it a new encoding scheme, so it’s an escape hatch to introduce something new

RH: when we get to where we’re down to 2 single byte opcodes, is that the time to declare a scheme like that?

AR: We can just reassign a single opcode

DG: the only thing is that everyone who is using it now is only using it for internal opcodes… 

[temporary notes outage, lost my connection]

FM: They mark areas of future expansion as reserved.

AR: We essentially do that, at least in the appendix with the opcodes. It just says reserved. Technically it doesn’t mean anything but expresses the intent. Reserved can mean different things… really this discussion is about “what is the meaning of reserved”

BT: This is why having some language in the spec like VM does might make sense.

AR: that makes sense. 

CW: do people feel like we need to have more coordination at a higher level about which opecodes are being used by proposals, maybe at the CG level?

TL: Sounds helpful, but probably separate

FM: do we have any measure about how many opcodes are coming?

AR: The most ones are not single byte ones, no single byte ones in the pipeline asfaik. Call_ref, control flow related

DG: wrt the opcode prefixes for proposals, it seems fairly simple to add to the proposal repo which opcodes are being used. Not set in stone or merged but a reasonable way to surface

AR: could also be used for type opcodes, where we had minor conflicts

BT: could also have a convention where proposals never use final opcodes, until they get merged into the spec.

BT: Basically when you get a prefix, and then it gets recycled when it’s ready to be merged.

CW: that would probably work better once we start seeing fewer proposals with foundational changes to the type system. Right now not everything we’re adding is neatly under a prefix

AR: Other than Simd, we don’t have proposals with a large number of instructions. For GC for example, I would assume that we would do some renumbering before merge, seems unavoidable that such a thing would have to be coordinated somehow

DG: one note about that is that usually with renumbering, we do sometimes have to coordinate with tools and engine, so the churn is hard sometimes

AR: yeah thats why to only do it once at the end.

DG: on the original issue, maybe we could do a consensus poll to add a non-normative note in the spec and leave the opcode as is. do es anyone object?

AR: no objections but ill say that currently the spec doesn’t say anything about backwards compatibility. We could even remove random opcodes. If we say something very specific about 0xff we should maybe say something about our intent regarding compatibility too.

CW: If there should be a wider scheme for someone that might use it shouldn’t use 0xff, there’s no way to say that instead of a non-normative note

TL: agree that we should say something about our intent generally but i think it ‘s fine if we do something about this case first, independently.

AR: It doesn’t have something fancy, can have a couple of points in the appendix about what types of changes we are ok with and what we aren’t. And the 0xff one could be another bullet there

TL: If that would be simple to do, we do have a pretty clear what our backwards compat there

AR: We can list it, and say []

CW: or just that it’s not exhaustive….

DG: It sounds like we like this idea. We can take the specifics offline.  Does anyone want to start this up with a draft?

AR: I can. I guess I should reopen the issue?

DG: I think I already did.. So, we can follow up on GH, I don’t think there’s anything else we need to discuss live here.


### Resolve handling of const expressions (issue)[https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1522] [15 mins]
       - Poll: pick web/interpreter semantics or pick spec semantics?

AR: This has to do with our constraints on constexprs. They occur in global initializers, offsets for element segments, and as elements themselves (since 2.0). I think those are the only places. We are also introducing a default for table elements. For global initializers, we intended that they cannot refer to other globals except imported ones. There was an inconsistency between the spec and reference interpreter (other implementations mostly match the ref interpreter)

I think the spec said the other one could use globals, and the reference interpreter implemented it the other way, no real test coverage except for some commented out spec tests, that leads to some divergence for this corner case. We can disallow global.get, the web engines all follow the interpreter, 

Web engines all follow the spec interpreter, wasm3 and wasmtime agree with the spec. Wasmer also agrees with the ref interpreter. I would propose to follow the majority (the reference interpreter) and change the spec. It’s very minor, we could almost regard it as a typo. Technically that’s a breaking change in the spec since it restricts things that were allowed before

I doubt any real program would depend on this behavior, none of the web engines practice have this so we may not be breaking anything


NF (chat): wasmtime disallows non-imported globals, the issue opened doesn't reflect actual behavior

AR: so that’s what the interpreter does. So the majority is even bigger in favor of that behavior so that seems lke it makes the decision even easier to make the spec match the implementations.

RH: I would agree with that, it’s not trivial to implement the change, we can just make the minor change, and would be for that

AR: i agree, and it also seems more consistent in general, you don’t need different rules in different places.

AR: Does anyone disagree with that? We can do a unanimous poll

BT: are we clear that it is more general to allow them, rather than the restriction that was in the spec?

AR: yes. I think that’s why the engines ended up the way they did too.

RH: I may be remembering this wrong, doesn’t GC relax this behavior and what does that mean for data segments?

AR: yeah that may be true. So they become more linear.

RH what would that imply about data segments?

AR: we seem to be converging that all declaration should be kind of sequentlal. If we want to allow things to refer to others, it’s seemed to come up that we want to allow repeated sections. I would propose that all sections that come after globals and refer to them, and ones before can’t.


CW: Data after globals, 

AR: all of them can refer to all of globals. Are tables after globals? 

AR: Are tables after globals?

CW: they seem to be after globals.

AR: not sure why.

AR: There seems to be no way around us relaxing this order..

CW: the table section just declares the types of tables. Would there be need to refer to globals there?

AR: Not right now, but with reference proposal there will be a default element defined there. In the tables section, we shouldn’t mess up the ordering but that’s a separate discussion for later. Only comes with the GC proposal later

RH: something like this does seem inevitable but i’d still prefer to deal with it later and just handle the current issue.

BT: Since we’re only talking about using globals at start of global initialization, it doesn’t restrict what can be in the global initializer

CW: nor at the level of instructions but it might affect which globals can be referred to.

BT: Global initializers are separate than the table offset

AR: offsets only appear in segments, not in table definitions. They go after globals.

CW: The problem with the tables will be the non defaultable types, but that’s something for the GC proposal to work out.

AR: yeah. Technically we could already discuss it in the funcref proposal but it’s just not pressing enough there.

CW: We have time for bikeshedding, in the long term should we have table initializers after the global initializers?

AR: I think the general fix is just relaxing the section ordering and allowing repeated sections. It’s come up so many times that I think we’ll have to do that.

TL: Not to get into a big discussion right now, we can introduce new section types that allow separate declarations/definitions

AR: That's more complex though because you have to define what it means to use something. Is it enough to have a declaration or does it have to go after the definition. It would make a difference what kind of use it is. We discussed that before but after some thought I decided it didn’t seem like a good idea.


TL: We should keep it on the table and discuss that more, the arbitrarily ordered section have overhead for producers, theyd  probably have to construct a DAG etc, which is more complex than right now

CW: Relaxing sections vs. repeating sections could that be a non-controversial thing to do right now

TL: you can get into situations where you need to merge

AR: For most sections relative sections don’t matter. You could reorder based on abstract dependency ordering

CW: Assuming such ordering exists, we should make sure that whatever relaxing we make, we don’t make that ordering not exist

AR: you can still define a total ordering that always works and your tools would use that

TL: Ideally we want to be where we don’t have such an ordering. We have uses where we can refer to globals fro mseg initzilizers, and also for referring to initizliers from globals. So we want to be able to support cycles.

AR: Then we really want repeated sections, otherwise you can get into a world with cycles which is bad

BT: I think we should just bite the bullet and do repeated sections. In wizard I had to refactor the code for it but it ended up better. It made it easier where you just an have as many sections as you want.

AR: I agree, but also see TL’s point but you would still have to compute the dependency upfront, but probably not too hard

TL: I’m willing to be convinced that repeated sections is better, but from what I’ve worked on it doesn’t seem like it. So we should at least discuss it more.

AR: General opinion is to avoid recursion when you can
AR: but getting back to the original issue, it sounds lke we’re on the same page wrt fixing the spec to match the implementations? I have PRs already for that, so can we just merge it?

<no objections raised, consensus is unanimous>

DG: any other comments?

LW: Somewhat against later repeated sections, working through module linking, came around to being in favor of repeated, but acyclic sections, then hopefully sometime when we get module linkling in the core spec, that’s something we would need

AR: the mutual recursion already comes up if we have type imports, since they will be recursive with type definitions. That will get ugly if we don’t have dependency ordering.

BT: Exactly why I needed to implement repeated sections

TL: Are we going to get where the ordering of types in the type section is overly constrained? There are some now, and if we impose additional constraints about interleaving with other sections, could we be in a situation where there is no correct ordering?

AR: That could only happen if you wanted some kind of recursive type that refers to an import or vice versa, which is something the current semantics won’t be able to support anyway, we are weaker than what equi-recursive types would support anyway. Theoretically that could happen

LW: seems nice if the general rule is that definitions are acyclic. And then if there are exceptions we call them out specially and make sure we are careful about it, the way we do with isorecursive.

TL: No reason to hold the meeting up for these brain teasers


AR: it is relevant. With module systems if you want recursive modules and want to instantiate something whose type depends on [the imported?] module, but then you are also into recursive modules, where you don’t want to be anyway.
