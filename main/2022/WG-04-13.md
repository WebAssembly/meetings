### Discussion

### Proposal to publish the current main branch of the Core, JS API, and Web API specs as `WD-wasm-{core,js-api,web-api}-1.1`

EP: I dusted off sphinx2HTML. Got a worfklow using respec which takes that output and puts it into W3C format.

Our charter ran out a month ago. W3 approved a short continuation of the old charter, and I am ready to publish a snapshot of the spec from yesterday. I checked a few diffs in the git log and ensured that they show up in the doc. I’m working from gh-pages branch for core and main for js-api and web-api

AR: gh-pages is automated, so it’s updated anytime theres a commit to main

EP: yeah the reason is that I’m using the bikeshed source for js-api and web-api so i can locally change status from editors draft to working draft. I’m using gh-pages for core just because I’m using the HTML output from there.

AR: it get generated from main if you build it there. It just gets committed to gh-pages. 

EP: I can try running the publication process against that

AR: yeah I don’t think there’s anything built in gh-pages, it’s just copied over.

EP: I was just going to use the list of finished proposals as the list of what’s changed since the last document.

AR: the spec has an appendix section which has a list of changes with a little more granularity

EP: so I can point to a subset of that

AR: we didn’t even have it before so everything there is new this time.

EP: so the proposal is to publish this snapshot. It’s not published yet but can be seen at https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-wasm-js-api-1.1-20220414/ (or https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-wasm-core-1.1-20220414/)

LW: so we’re calling this officially version 1.1? We independently landed on that inside the other doc

EP: yeah it just seemed right.

LW: it’s basically semver.

EP: I will have to make one manual patch this time around, but in the future we can publish automatically anytime we commit to main.

AR: in the core API, am I missing the TOC? I just see the first page

EP: you should see a big table of contents

AR: in Chrome it works, on Safari maybe not.

It works for DS in Safari and for EP in Firefox, maybe not for LW in Firefox. There may be a content blocker blocking an analytics script, but it’s not clear why that would affect the TOC. Disabling the content blocker seems to make everything load. After some looking at developer tools trying to diagnose exactly what’s happening, EP will follow up with other W3C folks.

EP: I propose we publish the working draft anyway, but we’ll try to get it fixed.

AR: makes sense. Probably we also want to tag the main repo with the version we publish. Previously we had tags like wg-1.0

EP: I pulled this yesterday so if someone wants to create a tag 

DS: ok I can create wg-1.1.draft1

Proposal: Publish the working draft from today.

LW: does this go through the stages and become a REC?

EP: no, this would be going to evergreen

LW: what exactly does that mean?

EP: basically we get to what was previously called candidate recommendation. But we can stay there and keep updating it, rather than going all the way to REC. New changes come in, they go to working draft, and they go to CR whenever we want. And we can keep doing that without freezing and going to REC.

AR: does that mean the versions are never actually released?

EP: we can go to a REC anytime we want but if we choose not to, we just keep republishing the CR

AR: so do we bump the version number?

EP: oh I see, I don’t know

LW: do we have a history of versions?

AR: It would still be good to have version numbers, it makes it easier to reason about feature sets that are implemented in a particular engine or whatever. Easier to communicate. I think we should make more regular releases from now on with updated version numbers.

LW: so maybe our ideal is something with minimal process for making docs (evergreen) but which lets us have a history of version snapshots. 

AR: yeah if we can cycle on version numbers while staying on CR that would be ideal. What does the W3C page say officially about the version right now? Will it just say 1.1 forever or how does someone find out that they aren’t looking at the current version?

EP: the REC says “this is what 1.0 was” and will point to the latest. There’s always a “latest” link. 

LW: RECs point to the newest corresponding CR?

EP: yes they should.

LW: will the newest CR point to the previous CR so we can trace backward?

EP: I think so

LW: webassembly.github.io would be a great place to collect those links so we can have a full list.

AR: so when we vote on this, is there another step?

EP: that’s our 1.1, and then the second question is whether we set up autopublishing. So we need to figure out if this will let us do what we want, and when to push the button.

AR: yeah I assume version number bumps will have to be at least partially manual. And document how to do it.

EP: it sounds like we aren’t quite ready to say exactly what we want to do about auto publishing then. I can check with W3C about how it works. And then we have to decide when to do it

AR: annually would be nice

LW: or we could bump each time we merge a proposal

AR: we could even rewrite history if we wanted with the existing proposals. 

EP: implementations may be spotty in their implementation of the first feature set.

LW: hopefully not too much.

EP: I’m not sure I know how to publish 5 versions at once tomorrow

AR: do we actually need to publish them all?

LW: could we call this 1.6 and not publish the earlier ones? We could put them in the appendix but not make documents.

AR: nontrapping ops and signext could be together, and reference types and bulk memory can’t be separated

So that would be
1.0 (mutable globals)
1.1 (nontrapping ops, signext)
1.2 (multi-value)
1.3 (bigint)
1.4 (reftypes and and bulk memory)
1.5 (SIMD)


[Philippe Le Hegaret joins]

PLH: it’s weird because you generally only have version numbers when you go to REC. it doesn’t really make sense to have version numbers if you never go to REC. if you don’t want to go all the way to the end of the project.

DS: we could just ignore the official “version number” and just make numbered milestones with the feature sets

LW: what if we have an evergreen CR, and what we call it inside the doc changes over time.

PLH: you can have your own names in the doc. But if you are in evergreen, you don’t have a “version”

AR: which terms are reserved i.e. used by the W3C process?

PLH: version, series, family (level is the same as version in our system)

LW: minor version? If each REC is a major version, we just iterate on the minor version?

AR: not really needed, there are so many synonyms

PLH: we encode the version number in the URL. and the version is in the systems internally. So if you try to change pieces of it, there could be issues. The “latest” link could not have a version. You can still call the next one 1.1 but it won’t be exposed everywhere

LW: what we want to avoid if there’s confusion about how they interact. If we start a new system it could be 2.0 and then we have the internal milestones

PLH: some other groups are hiding the version in the doc and it’s only in the URL

AR: could we call it 1.01?

LW: it’s like the first version was 1, and if we go to 2, we could potentially cut a REC and this would be 2.x

PLH: yeah we could just keep 2 in the URL and do whatever you want to inside the doc (call it 2.4 or anything else)

Post meeting:
In some followup email discussion, it was decided that it makes the most sense to update the official W3C version to 2, which becomes evergreen. We will use release numbers within the doc to designate “minor” or “milestone” revisions, which will be documented (e.g. in the change history in the appendix). Usually this would be when a new proposal is merged.
