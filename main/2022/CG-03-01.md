#### Update on [ES Module Integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration) (Asumu Takikawa) [30 min]

AT Presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12cZ3FQizIJ7GGhegdSzRjnGp2l-gFsTlXfvUsAdN2No/edit?usp=sharing)

- WASM modules currently require (comparatively) heavy lifting to instantiate
- ESM integration allows ES6 module import statements to perform all instantiation/compilation
- Also allows WASM module `(import)` declarations to import ES6 modules
- Spec has been stalled in phase 2 since 2019; no web engines had supported, no test suite
- JS API spec draft: https://webassembly.github.io/esm-integration/

Recent developments:
- WebKit implementation landed behind experimental flag: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236268
- WebAPI tests added to Web Platform Tests
- still not a high priority for other browsers, need real-world use cases (CG member input point)
- Node.js has support behind experimental flag, Deno had support but removed it
- Webpack has experimental support; any Webpack community members can provide more information about its status?

Current state of proposal/spec:
- ESM integration only exposes instantiated modules. Should it expose uninstantiated modules as well?
  - Possible syntax mechanism: JS import reflection (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-reflection)
  - Current plan is to keep this as a future extension (CG member input?)
- import assertions: current plan, do not require for WASM (https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/issues/42)
- import maps: probably already works, since ESM modules in same namespace as WASM
- WASM exports: should exports object be a _module namespace object_ (and not just a frozen JS object)?
  - Probably out of scope for this proposal

Next steps:
- Has met technical requirements for phase 3, how does CG feel about moving forward?

FM: about CSP: I assume the proposal is to use the script-src policies for importing wasm modules. The problem is that the allowlist in CSP isn’t a good idea. We’ve been talking about having a separate policy verb (wasm-src rather than script-src). Do you have any thoughts about that?

AT: not an expert on CSP, not a very strong opinion. With the current plan, we would go with script-src, but if there’s a specific wasm way of doing it, not opposed to that. What is the plan for wasm-src?

FM: So far it’s just an informal discussion. Outside of esm integration, there is currently a keyword for wasm, it’s a bit of a hack. There’s been discussion about having a separate policy just for specifying wasm. People would like to have different CSP policies for wasm and JS. So that's one driver, the other is that the style of the policy, we’d rather not inherit the script-src style.

AT: Is it an issue that Wasm scripts can also import JS scripts? How do the policies interact in that case?

FM: In pure wasm, it’s not an option. It would be with ESM integration. We’d have to discuss that. When the loader loads a JS module, it would use script-src policy, and use wasm-src when loading a wasm module? Probably something like that.
Another question: wasm imports and exports more than just functions. There’s tables, memories, tags, etc. How would that work with esm integration?

AT: I glossed over this in the presentation, semantics of the proposal does support the other forms of exports as well. The other direction is that while it should work, it is possible to have cyclic structures, it may not work exactly in that case due to ordering issues, i.e. when a reference is undefined before it can used. In normal cases it should work fine

FM: does ESM allow cyclic graphs?

AT: it does between JS and wasm, but not between only wasm modules

FM: There’s a lot of work on the component proposal, and the module linking proposal, how would that integrate with the proposal? 

AT: some of the module documents already mention ESM integration. One aspect is module linking might require more features from ESM integration; the module linking proposal also allows you to import and export modules (e.g. adapter modules). So that might need additional capability for ESM integration. That’s one reason for the interest in import reflection. Probably these could be added on in a future proposal

FM: so if you  had a component with internal linkages , youd be able to add that as a component in JS?

DC: I have a couple strong opinions about CSP and a separate policy verb: one is about adoption and the other is about security. Given that it’s always possible for running JS to manually load wasm and run it, in that case the script-src policy effectively controls access to running wasm. Wasm doesn’t have more capabilities than JS because it’s relying on the JS host to get outside access. My adoption concern is that if wasm security is under a different verb, and whatever admin runs a site hasn’t explicitly added it, then it hinders the ability of devs to transition from JS to wasm. The other is about security. If you have someone that has a different policy where script-src is more restrictive than wasm-src, then a malicious actor can escape the script-src policy by compiling their code to wasm instead of just using JS. that seems like a pitfall.

FM: These are good points, but off topic for ESM integration, I would suggest raising these issues on the CSP [repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy)

DG: I’m excited about seeing progress on this. For stage 3, are we accepting web-platform-tests as an acceptable test suite for this proposal? For this one I think it makes sense, wondering if anyone had concerns.
…
I don’t hear anything; I would recommend making that explicitly when going to stage 3.
I’d also be interested in hearing from browser vendors about how they feel about this.

RH: (Lars isn’t here today, proxying for him.) I think we are pretty neutral on this. I think we are ok with having a phase 3 poll, it’s just not a high priority for implementation for us.

DG: I think Chrome is somewhere between neutral and positive generally; we’d really like to see use cases, that would help us establish a priority for implementation as well.

#### Update on [Branch Hinting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/branch-hinting) (Yuri Iozzelli) [20 min] 

YI Presenting [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14DSYWsEU7w_EFyhnOogAW_m6gKVwuDbv/view?usp=sharing)

CW: [regarding testing]: I’m sure engines would also be interested in tests with an invalid hint section, to test that semantics are still preserved

YI: Makes sense, roundtrip test wouldn’t easily include a test like this one, I agree having invalid hints would be useful - but even an invalid hint can’t make the module fail validation,

CW: I think the simplest thing would be 2 versions of the module one with invalid hints and one with no hints, and check that the output is the same.

YI: What kind of output do you mean? Output of the module would still be the same. Take the V8 implementation for example - a hint in a function that doesn’t exist, all the previous hints, and variables would be discarded, but the module output would still be the same

CW: Yes, I agree that what I said would test far less than the full report would show

FM: Maybe this is covered by a valid custom section..

YI: yes. In the spec it says it’s not a valid hint. It’s more tricky because if you take e.g. the V8 implementation. From an engine perspective it’s costly to see in advance if there’s an instruction there or not. Right now V8 will accept it when parsing the section, and then when parsing the code, if there’s a branch instruction it will check for a hint. But if there is a hint that doesn’t point to a branch it will just be ignored. Maybe we should change the spec? It might be a waste of resources to do extra work to validate it.

CW: Is it not the case that an invalid custom section doesn’t correct module validation? Can we discard the hints lazily?

YI: I think it would be correct to discard them even lazily. If you already used some of the hints but they are wrong, do you have to go back and discard, or can you use them anyway

DG: What kind of tests do you have for this in the engine?

YI: I think that for the engine it’s easier. In V8 there’s one test; it’s a unit test, so it just chekcs in C++ some bytes that represent the modules, and it asserts that the internal map of branch hints has the expected contents, so that’s pretty easy. It’s harder to have something that can be shared, that describes the behavior in a portable/engine-neutral way.

DC: Are the roundtrip tests testing only that the binary stays the same? Or do they mandate the intermediate text format as well? In other words, can the raw format of the binary be embedded into the module, or do the tests mandate using the textual annotation format?

YI: could be either way. Right now the testsuite allows binary modules to be encoded in text, or we could talk about the actual text format with annotations. There are a few tests in the annotation proposal, it just checks whether the annotations are accepted, but not semantics.

JK: As an engine implementor, I don’t feel great about the report production type of test, firstly we want tests that work in the wild, and secondly, this report would be very specific to the tes.

YI: that was my expected reaction from engines as well. This is one end of the spectrum. The other end is no tests, hopefully we can have something in the middle

CW: I think from a core wasm, the thing we’re most interested in is testing that even really weird hint sections don’t affect the observable behavior of the module.

YI: This is similar to the current approach with the annotations proposal as well, one of the things blocking from phase 4 are custom sections, there’s no guarantee that the annotations are preserved in the custom sections, so the round trip tests would be useful for this as well

BT: as far as testing the reporting: I agree that not every engine wants a reporting mode. But even if you have just one (e.g. ref interp), then you have at least one encoding of the expected parsing behavior, then new engines that come along can at least compare to that, even if it’s not expected that other engines reproduce the reporting.

YI: This will be like in the middle, the reference interpreter does implement this in strict mode, but we don’t expect V8 to actually implement it

BT: yes it’s an aid to engine implementers, even if they aren’t required to do the reporting.

DG: Other questions, or thoughts on branch hinting? Thanks to the presenters, and thanks for the discussion
