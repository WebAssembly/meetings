### Proposals and discussions

#### Update on [Relaxed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/) (Zhi An Ng) [15 min]

ZA presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ofBkgbW2AjYM4oayjTPTH3PCbyEn6W-q3GN67qSEigQ/edit?usp=sharing)

CW: when the top bit is 1, is it completely nondeterministic what the result is, or constrained?

ZA: It is constrained to the two possibilities to treating it as a uint8 or an int8

CW: do we expect producers to rely on the fact that the same columns of behaviors are selected for each instruction?

ZA: Min/Max, do you expect producers to rely on picking results from the same column? My intention is showing Min/Max together is that the same column is selected for both, they’re separate instructions. For FMA we want the results from the same column, we specify FMZ in terms of FMS

AR: a similar question: on the other slide (comments) you said that really people are expected to only rely on the last case (rather than the corner cases). Do we need to specify that correlation at all? Compared to what we do with NaNs, we don’t specify any correlations but we thought that’s not very useful. So I wonder why we do that here, what’s the use case? It seems it could have even more relaxation.

ZA: The reason why we chose to constrain is to make it easier to test, and so we don’t have weird values showing up. If we relax it too much, for the first case of relaxed min, we can have a completely unrelated result to show up. We don’t want nonsensical results

AR: you can still constrain it, like we do with nans. But why do you need to specify correlation between the different cases when nobody should be relying on that. I think that actually makes it harder to test, you have semi-defined behavior but you have to test the whole matrix, which seems worse than making it completely unspecified. So maybe less specification is better?

CW: It  still seems that you want the different edges to be one off

AR: right but do you need to specify the correlation? We don’t want to loosen it beyond the set that’s mentioned here.

CW: Does the fact that we specify NaN bits interfere with optimizations?

ZA: I don't think so

TL: on the tools side, we just ignore that and use whatever platform the optimizer is running on.

AR: Maintaining this correlation might be harder,

TL: are you talking about the correlation between FMA and FMS?

AR: The fact that we say for each case we can pick the same column

CW: I think Andreas means the first, 2nd 3rd line you have to pick the same column within one instruction

AR: Why don’t we treat them as sets, and it’s not specified you get the same ones, we don’t care, we shouldn’t rely on these cases. Keep it more loose and limit it to the set of values

TL: it happens in the tools too. I was just implementing these in Binaryen, and what do we do in the precompute optimization. But what if it’s precomputed with different semantics that it eventually runs in. but if we make no guarantees from one execution to another, it would be safe to do.


CW: Semantics that AR was proposing would also reassure me, mixed execution across GPU/CPU or different steppings of the same processor - keeping the strict semantics would be complicated

ZA: These are good points. I think I’ll bring it back to the SIMD subgroup meeting. I’m concerned about other instructions. For min and max it's more obvious that it would work because of the nondeterminism in NaN. FOr swizzle and others it’s not about NaNs and we don’t have existing nondeterminism. So I’d like to see how the subgroup thinks.

AR: In the 0 case, you don’;t have 

CW: If someone somewhere really is relying on this extra specificity, i uges that would be a concern

AR: yeah if someone is, that could be a problem actually.

DG: from the user perspective, I don’t know that anyone is really relying on this, these instructions are used more for performance, and not necessarily relied on for accuracy
We had hoped to constrain the nondeterminism in some way so that the results aren’t completely unspecified. But I do understand the concerns, and don’t really expect too many objections about this in the SIMD group

AR: Would remove implementation defined behavior, and just be non-deterministic which is allowed

TL: for full transparency I actually do expect users to depend on this kind of thing, those who are already looking at engine implementations and looking at what instructions come out. They are already operating below the level of the spec, and we shouldn’t worry about them.

AR: What are the users? Are they tied to a single instruction or engines? How are they working?

TL: The folks working on some of the SIMD kernels for things like video processing are looking at the actual output from V8 and choosing their instrucitons based on that

AR: then they won’t really have portable code…

TL: yes they do this for multiple platforms and choose their instructions accordingly. Which we aren’t thrilled about, but we can’t really stop them either.

AR: Do they probe the user version? Or the CPU version?

TL: yes they are checking the platform and are deliberately going underneath the abstraction that we have. We can’t stop them, but we shouldn’t go out of our way to support them either.

DG: it's not so much that they rely on certain probing hardware, more that SIMD applications usually have existing code for the underlying platforms and when abstracting up a layer they run into unexpected behavior on different platforms

KM: I can’t wait to get a web compatibility bug because of this…

CW: in theory there could be more of an issue if the behavior is more tightly specified than if it's more completely nondeterministic [?]

ZA: One of the reasons we chose fixed projections - when given this input, a particular implementation always returns Z2, when we relax it again - it’s a non-deterministic set of inputs relaxes that further

AR: Why do we want this?

ZA: First I’m assuming that all the instructions would be defined the same way, not all the instructions are specified the same way. Mixing fused/unfused results gives results that could be wrong for the algorithm. You could feature detect ahead of time, i.e. with a module to check if you get fused/unfused results, then you can use that information in the future for a computation

AR: When you say it’s out there, what do you mean? 

ZA: I guess the point of the specification is that we want to be specific about what the results can be. Since we are talking about the spec text we want to be more strict

AR: Do we want implementation dependent behavior? It’s quite a cross roads for the language as a whole, the use case you mentioned if we need to support it, then it would need to be implementation defined

TL: People will do it in practise anyway

CW: Are we assuming that code already exists? Or is this a more abstract concern?

AR: the risk that people will probe is always there, but if we specify it there’s a higher probability that people will rely on it

TL: Tradeoff between trying to guide users to do what we expect and trying to describe and support what users are actually doing. In the case of SIMD, there’s significant divergence there.


AR: For the interpreter I wonder if we should produce all possible behaviors randomize? If you have code you can run it against the interpreter and run it against it to see if it works for some subset of possible input values - we do this for the threads proposal that also has some non-determinism. It increases the coverage especially if we go towards implementation defined behavior.

ZA: Yes, it would make sense to have the interpreter emit a random correct output. It could lead to flaky tests if people run against the reference interpreter.

AR: As soon as the tests are flaky, they have a bug

ZA: How often to people test their code against the interpreter? Might be useful in the engines too

CW: wasmtime fuzzes against it for SIMD instructions

TL: Fuzzers would be very sensitive to the non-deterministic nature of the instructions.

ZA: Most fuzzers check for crashes rather than exact results

TL: Binaryen fuzzer runs on the interpreter, and the Wasm Engine and compares the output

CW: wasmtime also compares outputs.

DG: At least testing the non-relaxed versions of the instructions should be possible. We can add options to allow that.

**Poll:** Move relaxed-simd to Phase 3

CW: We should definitely get the story for how to precisely specify the non-determinism straight before phase 4.

#### Update on [JS Promise Integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration) (Francis McCabe) [15 min]

DS: I didn’t get this on the agenda 24 hours before the meeting as we usually do for polls (sorry about that). The purpose of that rule is to allow people to know whether they really need to be at the meeting. We seem to have just about everyone present in this meeting that usually attends, and this is only for stage 2, so I think it’s OK to go ahead and allow the poll. If people have objections or concerns that they want to raise, they are definitely encouraged to do that in followup meetings, github, etc.
