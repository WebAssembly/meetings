### Proposals and discussions

#### Update on [Code Annotations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/issues/167) (Yuri Iozzelli) [10 mins]

YI presenting [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DC4iLQMT9m7MLqdAq6IZFwXmxJtCjgDN/view?usp=sharing).

AZ: does offset 0 mean the function itself, so we could annotate functions?

YI: yes

RW: from instruction tracing POV, this makes sense, I like this.

YI: Since branch hunting and IT are similar proposals, it makes sense that we are on the same page, and can continue to work on it

TL: I’m also eager to use this for non-standards-track annotations in LLVM, that would be useful.

BT: Looks good, we had discussed some time ago about constant-time wasm, and there were new instructions proposed there, BH does not include new instructions but maybe we should add a note of what is added/excluded in this proposal. May make sense to have a discussion, and document when we use this mechanism, vs. something else. 

YI: I think for CT, the space ovhearhead would be high, there would be a lot of annotations, i think we can think about having a guideline on when to use it and when not.

BT: Makes sense, thanks

RW: I’d be interested in understanding the guidelines a bit more when we get there. There could be variants of SIMD instructions, maybe rounding or differences between different architectures might go into this kind of section.

AR: One criteria - only stuff that doesn’t execution semantics should go there, anything else should be more explicit, and not be in a custom section. 

CW: I think as a general rule, some optimizer that doesn’t understand the custom section should be comfortable throwing it away

DS: LLVM has a similar construct - metadata, their guidelines are that a pass that doesn’t understand the metadata “must” throw it away. We can’t necessarily mandate that tools do that but we should provide similar guidelines. 

YI: we can use the same language in our guidelines

AR: ct wasm also doesn't affect execution semantics, but it is supposed to affect validation, but you can make that option i guess, so it could still be a custom section in a way

CW: It’s an example of a borderline case, how wide do you expect the semantic guarantees tobe? Constant time is a guarantee that some semantics are preserved, and it might be unsafe to not preserve them. 

BT: my reasoning is that all execution tiers need to look at those annotations, otherwise the engine is wrong, doesn't preserve the security properties. for interpreter, it's nice to be in bytecode so you know you need to implement constant time instructions there

#### Discuss [streamlined process for simple proposals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/857) (Petr Penzin)

PP: Do we need this? 

AR: this sounds like the simplification would mainly be collapsing some of the phases. That might not require something new, could we just allow proposals to advance 2 phases at once. Other than that, have you looked at actual criteria that could be removed for simple ones? I’m not sure there are real ones that can be skipped (other than ones that obviously don’t apply to a particular proposal). 

LH: This came up because I was trying to hold up the relaxed-simd proposal because proposing a new instruction and getting it through the process is a heavy weight process, and for an already established framework, we can make the process more lightweight and not have to go through the multiple steps would be nice

AR: moving faster definitely makes sense. My question was really, is there anything else, and if not, do we need to do something concrete, other than have general agreement that we can move faster for appropriate proposals

DG: what is the accepted framework where we decide to even move faster? Even to move to phase 2 we need design consensus, e.g. is it a good instruction even to add (for SIMD)?

AR: isn’t it enough just to say, we are here now at phase 0 but we have all the deliverables for phase 2, why not move directly if the requirements are there? It’s a judgement call if the proposal is simple enough, but it could be case-by-case. But it seems enough just to have all the requirements so we can just skip phases.

FM: when someone makes a presentation, they can propose to skip a number of phases, and justify it

PP: do we want to have limits on this? If we want to skip, say, phase 3, would that be ok?

FM: If someone wants to skip, they can propose and justify and we could vote. 

BT: wouldn’t that justification just consist of meeting the requirements? They all have to be met in the end.

FM: someone in the group proposes, and someone disposes

AR: There’s nothing in the process that requires having time intervals, you can ask for phase 1,2,3, whenever, but the CG can decide whether we have consensus and whether we have an obvious improvement.

BT: one thing that might be interesting: we should have records of when each proposal advanced, so we should have data about how long each proposal speds in each phase, and see if we have a bottleneck

TL: last time we promoted a small trivial proposal was probably years ago, sign extension instructions. At a high level, recently we haven't tried advancing a tiny proposal through the phases. We have experience with phases being heavyweight, because in recent memory all the proposals are heavy. I will be interested to see someone try to push a proposal as quickly as possible, see how it performs under certain guidelines. Then we have concrete but anecdotal evidence on how to make adjustments.

DG: I think even the written guidelines haven’t changed since then. We could just add a note to the doc saying that you can actually propose more than 1 at a time. We could just have something to let people know that it’s ok, and try it out with a small proposal.

LH: that sounds good

DS: anyone has concerns about this, if we shouldn't make a note like what we discussed?

<No objections>

#### Update on [Relaxed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/) and poll for phase 2 [15 min]

ZA presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12QU5Jb2BXvPmhkLWlI2-1XDzVVDzSlLwJIkCGucxPMo/edit?usp=sharing)

AR: They don’t exist on other platforms, web not the only platform

ZA: That is true

CW: Surprisingly powerful based on the problem statement described earlier, this means that different environments can describe different fpenvs, is there a use case for that? 

ZA: Distributed over different arches/engines and you could have different fpenvs, not immediately useful but there are different 

CW: when I heard that the point of this is that youll target instruction sequences that are small but might have different outcomes on different architectures. It sounds like the motivation for fpenv is to guarantee that 2 different instructions have the same output? Is this for optimization?

ZA: Two different instructions have the same output, when the same inputs if they have the same fpenv, it’s to prevent something funny like this example happening <consistency slides>

TL: it’s basically to help programmers reason about what will happen and give a stronger guarantee than “it willbe nondeterministicn every time you call it”. For systems that migrate workloads across systems, they will have to check that they don’t move workloads across architectures if that will violate the way the fpenvs are used. A pure function can be pure and always return the same result.

BT: Is the rounding mode going to be a part of this env? Or will it need something different? 

ZA: Right now no, rounding mored are still non-deterministic

RT: i would describe that the instructions are underspecified but determinized by an an external environment,

ZA: yea, the instructions are non-deterministic until the module is instantiated.

AR: The code mobility usecase confused about it, it wouldn’t give the same output anyway

TL: this is for engines that transparently migrate workloads without re-instantiating.

BT:  Not the same fpenv they instantiated on?

TL: yes or just not move code to environments with inconsistent behavior.

AR: In that case why would you need the fpecnv anyway?

DG: it tells implementations when they can and can’t move things in this way

CW: You could have the same result by underspecifying the instruction in the spec

DaG: a more helpful use case could be tiling a large image, maybe you don’t care about the exact mode, but you don’t want to have visible boundaries where they change

AR: I’m still confused, the assumption seems to be that within the same engines this could give different outputs for different environments in the same engine

BT: one use case might be GPUs, they might put a kernel onto a GPU

CW: you’d need an explicit fpenv if you have more than one, or swap them out. Unless you need to make it explicit which version you’re relying on, i don’t see why you’d need an explicit fpenv

BT: You can specify in different pieces of code that pieces of code need to be self consistent but they can be different.

ZA: The union of consistency needs to include a module, fpenv is the way we want to say that we have consistency, we want to have some sort of environment/module but we don’t have a way to say that right now  

CW: that sounds like a problem of the language of the spec, to say what needs to happen in a particular environment

AR: It makes sense if you want to allow multiple behaviors within the same engine - this is the right design - if you want to see different realms of behavior to coexist.

CW: Doesn’t sound like any examples so far need this feature

AR: if you allow multiple realms, you’d want to allow a module to have more than one, otherwise they aren’t composable. I just don’t know why you’d need to have more than one at a time.

TL: The plan of record is to have the linker produce a simple fpenv for the output module, and not import/export. In the future, in other toolchains may have more flexibility

BT: would it be reasonable to just say we have a 0 byte in these instructions, and extend it in the future?

CW: I guess that could work for now, that would mean that the default byte would be implicit, and the others would be explicit

RT: we can argue whether this is necessary, but is there a problem with doing this?

CW: it’s not idiomatic, we should have a reason why we’re having this explicit environment

BT: I can see the use case, but is it necessary, can we add a zero byte? And extend it in the future.

DG: It captures the intent of the odules, especially with shared nothing module linking, they don’t have enough information about the modules

LW: if we didn’t have this feature, when you statically link modules, they get the same env. I still don’t really see a use case where when modules call each other synchronously, they need to have different fpenvs.

ZA: Went over the allocated time, will take an AI to capture more concrete motivation and report back to the group.

#### Update on [Flexible Vectors](https://github.com/WebAssembly/flexible-vectors/) and poll for phase 2 [15 min]

<TODO: PP to add slides>

DS: Length of vector determined statically, there is a kind of non-determinism, at the time of compilation we don’t know what the vector length will be, so would it be useful to have an fpenv type of construct here as well? 

PP: I tried to avoid the kind of behavior we have in relaxed simd, I don’t know how you’d be able to mix things. I don’t think this is an MVP feature. I’d consider something along the lines of fpenv to be a future thing

CW: would this be another case where you’d add a 0 now and possibly an fpenv later then?

PP: Open to adding it, if you’re talking about vector lengths exclusively - in theory we could add to other instructions as well.. It’s a good question. Leaning against adding it as a first cut, but can discuss further

BT (chat): Seems like there could be space for a mechanism for different kinds of “envs”

TL: i do think the abstract problem of having a hardware environment determining part of the semantics is similar. So I think it would be good to have a consistent solution for that

PP: Don’t agree that we have to tie the semantics together, not the same thing

TL: is there any way in this proposal to observe the vector length?

PP: you can run some values and see how many have changed, it is observable in the same “fingerprinting” sense.

TL: similarity between this and fpenv is an observable value (a non det SIMD, or vector length), as long as there is a way to observe that, you have a non-deterministic value.

PP: the intent is different. The intent is to make users write algorithms that are agnostic to the vector length, and make them universal. So someone would run the same code on both architectures.

AR: You still have to distinguish between language semantics, it’s still observable that there is some heavy non-determinism here and is similar to the relaxed-simd case, it kind of leaks through the hardware

BT: is it the case that the only variable is the vector length? Or are there other things?

PP: yes, just the vector length

AR: It seems like accessing a lane takes a static lane index, if I don’t know how many lanes there are, how would I access a lane? 

DG: what kind of workloads will you be measuring this on? when it comes to wider vectors, a concern is e.g. alignment requirement. What will benefit from flexible vectors?

PP: the same things you’d use AVX for, e.g. image processing
DG: if we could call out the performance guarantees we are giving, right now it’s not clear, it could even vary on dfiferent Intel hardware. So it would be useful to say what kidn of performance we’d be providing.

DP (chat): Note that this proposal is very similar to what .NET did, which is has been in production for years. My impression was that the main problem with the .NET approach was that very few platform-independent operations were available for variable-size vectors, but the idea of variable size vectors is still, I think, a good one.
