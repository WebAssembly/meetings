DS: the previously-agreed thing, is that the same but with a different name?

FM: yes. I prefer the one without unsafe-eval


DG: I’m curious to hear from the other vendors?

LH: I don’t think we have any concerns about the proposal as written

KM: I agree with Lars, I think we want to have this capability

FM: In the absence of a formal vote, I’ll propose we rename this wasm-unsafe-eval and propose to web-app-sec on May 18, a week from today.

<no objections>

Naming?
    
DP: I for one prefer wasm-eval
 
FM: I do too; but I also don't want to delay this for the ultimate bikeshed

RT: “Unsafe” seems like bad branding?

FM: W3C TAG design principles #104 document recommends prefixing particularly dangerous operations with “unsafe”. Maybe JS itself should be marked unsafe, by the same logic.

ZB: Replace “eval” with “exec”?

RT: or "compile" - it seems the unsafe aspect is that the code can by dynamically determined


BT: Many long conversations with web platform people about the “wasm-unsafe-eval” vs “Wasm-eval”
We settled here to make progress.

Connotations from JavaScript unfortunately carried over. Probably not worth bike shedding, thus here we are
