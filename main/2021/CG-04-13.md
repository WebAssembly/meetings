### Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)

### Proposals and discussions

#### Announcement for 4/27 meeting: Scoping and Layering of Module Linking and Interface Types. 

**Note:** This is a 2Hr meeting starting an hour earlier than the usual meeting, as a pilot for having longer design forums virtually. Meeting led by Luke Wagner. 

#### Announcement: Derek Schuff and Luke Wagner as co-chairs of the working group. 

Excited to welcome Derek Schuff and Luke Wagner as co-chairs for the working group. Decided by [vote in the working group](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/main/2021/WG-02-10.md#proposals-and-discussions), email to public mailing list will follow, with avenues to voice concerns if any.

#### Proposal: Deepti Gandluri and Derek Schuff as co-chairs of the community group (10 min)

DG & DS have been working as defacto CG chairs in Ben Smith’s absence, and would like to formalize this with a vote. 

Chair selection process described in the charter: https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/
Pretty lightweight in the past - previous chair picks the next chairs. We didn’t have a full transition in place till now. 

Email to the public mailing list will go out soon, with avenues to voice concerns if any. Feel free to also reach out to webassembly-cg-chairs@chromium.org, or team-wasm-chairs@w3c.org in the mean time.

DG: provisional/consensus vote, mailing list will come after

(No objections, provisional vote passes)

#### Formalize SIMD subgroup (5 mins) 

DG: SIMD is in phase 4, SIMD proposal started before subgroup was a concept. It was productive, want to keep it going. With flexible-vectors and relaxed-simd, we want a joint place for discussions related to SIMD. Charter as open PRs on [relaxed-simd](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/pull/18), and [flexible-vectors](https://github.com/WebAssembly/flexible-vectors/pull/32) repositories. Champions of both proposals will co-chair this new subgroup. Consensus vote: anyone disagree to either forming SIMD subgroup, or having Petr and Zhi as subgroup chairs?

(No objections, SIMD subgroup is formed, with Petr and Zhi as co-chairs)

#### Vote to approve Lin Clark as a new chair of the WASI Subgroup, to replace Dan Gohman (5 min)

DanG: reflect that Lin has been running meetings for a few months, formalize it. I will still be involved in WASI. Anyone objects?

(No objections, Lin is the new chair for WASI subgroup)

#### Presentation+Discussion: Collaborative Garbage Collection, Ross Tate (20-30 min)

TODO(Ross Tate): link to slides

CW: How much work is done at runtime to register work with the cross ref manager. At each assignment, you need to create x-ref, register with the manager. Do you have to synchronize?

RT: I tried to track that, this should be pretty race friendly - I’m glossing over the roll over the epoch - have to deal with the information that GC can happen while the epoch change and stale info may be propagated. You may have some casts, the GC would do it - the program won’t have to worry about it. It should be pretty unnoticeable from the program’s perspective

CW: registering with manager at each assignment, is that right? Any static information to make that faster?

RT: So this is designed for where these things are coarse. Registering a cross reference corresponds to putting an externref into a table. You would extend Wasm tables with coloring references. 

CW: yup, make sense. In the case where you are expecting it to work well, you have some static information given a type, which GC is handling that type.

RT: The static info can be events, a very coarse system, A, B,C ,D can be different programs - it can just be a foreign function call. <Describes Java example>

LW: there is a membrane between a b c d, and only crossing it is where you care about cross references

RT: That would work too, works as a foreign function calls

LW: firefox implements this for compartment, and cross compartment references

RT: This is a simple algorithm, but couldn’t find where it existed.

AZ: have you thought about whether this can be used on the web? Seems like it requires integration with GC on web.

RT: This should be usable on the web, problem in the GC proposal is about multi threaded programs having JS references. Mjulti threaded programs could use this as a smart table, that way JS references can only be accessed in the program they belong to, but they have some information hidden about which references they belong to

AZ: the problem is that JS vm doesn’t give you the information that i have scan the roots or i have finished. Without that, don’t see how this can work.

RT: For Wasm, if you have a situation where all of them are linear memory programs talking to each other and not the host, we could use wams to implement the cross reference, if you do need to talk to the host, then you need some system to be able to talk to it, and the host is responsible for the coloring informatiion

KM: from impl perspective, is there an efficient way for manager to know epoch is done. Maybe atomic integer is outstanding out refs, when that gets to 0, and all roots 0, then you’re done?

RT: There’s a variety of ways to implement it depending on how much synchronization you want. The answer is there is a variety of implementation strategies, my sense is that if you think of this as generational - is not super critical for the program because of early clean up. The idea is that once ina while we release cycles and clean up eventually 

KM: if the operation is an instruction to mark refs, whatever the host wants to do, polling thing

RT: all this designed to b very black box, the x ref manager has many ways to implement it.

CW: i have misunderstood what x ref is, if i have an object that is managed by GC A, and because this is coarse grained, there is some operation to transfer from A to a compartment which corresponds to another language/runtime by B. Is the act of transferring the ref that creates the xref, or once i transfer the ref to b, does every assignment to one of B field creates a ref.

RT: I think it’s just the act of transferring, when you do a transfer of a cross reference, A is going to have some sort of proxy on the outside, and B will have one inside - when you assign fields you’re assigning the proxies, and B’s GC maintains a list of all it’s proxies, and the GC is responsible for maintaining the cross references. 

CW: so long as you keep the number of transfers between heaps low, it’s okay to have lots of assignment between xrefs objects

RT: It’s transfers of heaps for host integrated stuff, we can give it an externref, you don’t have to do anything - if it’s on the stack then the program knows about it. 

PP: will it be efficient to implement GC in Wasm?

RT: I think there’s been discussion on that - one thing that’s come up is that for efficiency, we need some way to walk the stack to collect the roots. That’s the one that’s brought up as a constraining factor.

PP: if we ever get to prototyping we can find out

<BACK TO SLIDES: Guarantees of system>

DE: How are we prioritizing this linear memory GC support vs the Wasm GC proposal? I thought in GC proposal scoping, we want to prioritize host GC over this? Maybe I misunderstood.

RT: probably cannot answer in 1 min. I wanted to focus on the technology, i will write up issue for the discussion

CW: complementary, take current GC proposal, you can add this, expose this as a type that comes from another GC

#### Update on Instrument Tracing

Jacob Abraham presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sjOqLLRJxYWim2NVGNF-zs1nAVSMKehvJiovBLKm6bo/edit?usp=sharing)

AR: abstractly speaking, what is the meaning of this instruction?

RW: IT’s a continuation of the trace instruction - lets us translate the source code to machine code

AR: if i don’t use that how would you interpret this instruction?

RW: Nothing or the Noop

AR: semantics is equivalent to a nop. Does semantics depend on the host, can inject anything we want?

RW: It would execute code, it’s a prefix - noop with a prefix and would automatically recognize the source to the trace, whether or not it’s an absolute instruction or not.. It would translate to a regular noop on an unsupported platform

AR: we don’t specify semantics in terms of any particular platform. IIUC, the abstract meaning of this is a nop really, no observable effect in any environment.

KM: Is there in the spec that says there’s no observable difference in the semantics?

RW: think that’s in the spec, have to go back to take a look at it

CW: should be an instruction rather than imported function that the host provides?

KM: It could be an imported function, or you call a different function vs. the custom section.

JA: essentially the trace instruction will be executed and only traced if a tool is attached/enabled. Regardless, the execution semantics stays the same. Only when you attach something, trace in browser or native instruction trace.

RW: They have the mark-id so it’s an arbitrary 

TL: how do you expect this to be surfaced in the browser? Do you expect some DevTools integration.

RW: JA created a prototype to do that. It could show up in browser. Can feed this into simulator and play with it, what if we increase cache, branch prediction, number of registers, etc. We can take that information. If we call it in Wasm and came back to JS and did some other things, we can trace that more accurately.

NF(chat): it can't be *just* a nop because you wouldn't want the compiler to move code across it, right?

DG: more questions, take it to repository, come back with a poll with some answers to questions.

RW: yea sounds good, will make progress

DG: feel free to answer questions on the chat
