### Discussions

#### Update on JS API for Stack Switching (Ross/Luke/Francis) [10 mins]

Design issue [link](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1425)

CW: No questions, looks cool.

RT: Process wise, we did something different. Iterated between a handful of people and ran ideas by the stack subgroup. Result incorporates a lot of ideas and iteration but is nice and simple.

DS: Seems non contentious, let’s do a consensus poll. Any objections to moving this to phase 1?

<No objections>

DS: Poll passes, will create a repo for this. 

#### Interface types discussion

<LW Presenting, [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qVbBsDFmremBGVKiOAzRk7svjinNq6LXfJ1DzeFwKtc)>

DE (chat): Also Factor uses a list of code points!

DD (chat): LE or BE or both? (about UTF-16)

CW (chat): just LE, same as Wasm

LW: just LE

BT (chat): Just to clarify: the binary format of modules has chosen UTF-8 for import and export names. We are not talking about changing that, correct? Just runtime strings in interface types?

LW: correct, import names unchanged

RB (chat): Isn't the UTF-8 replacement character multiple bytes?  How does that work?

CW (chat): There’s a copy anyway when sanitising, and the updated length is transmitted along with the string

LW: UTF-8 is multi-byte, the replacement character turns into multiple bytes in encoding, that’s expected

RT: Guessing a related question is whether the number of bytes is different from the original one with invalid characters, the length is different?

RB (chat): So the replacement string could be longer than the original?

LW: yea, that’s possible

CW: in Interface Types, the updated length is translated along with the string

LW: in general with transcoding you expect the length to change, this (replacement) is an instance of that. In general, we don’t know the length up front.

RT: Using the replacement path, you can’t use it if you don’t know the length upfront

LW: common case can be there is a single malloc of the right size, general case there is a realloc to account for different lengths, when going from UTF-8 to UTF-16, malloc first, then realloc, can be specified precisely in canonical abi.

KM (chat): Do these strings live in linear memory or in “host” memory?

DS: linear memory, communication between Wasm modules

LW: In the future when we have GC memory, that can be another option, but right now they will only live in linear memory.

DW (chat): Is Swift really UTF-8? It uses breadcrumbs (incl. many encodings), and would naturally end up with WTF-8 underneath.

AvK (chat): https://swift.org/blog/utf8-string/ suggests so. “Swift 5, like Rust, performs encoding validation once on creation, when it is far more efficient to do so. NSStrings, which are lazily bridged (zero-copy) into Swift and use UTF-16, may contain invalid content (i.e. isolated surrogates). As in Swift 4.2, these are lazily validated when read from.”

DW (chat): Yeah, wasn't able to figure this out as it only speaks about UTF-8

DW (chat): Does it replace lazily?

DW (chat): I don't think that the requirements for HTTP APIs are applicable here. When operating synchronously, these languages try to preserve integrity.

KM (chat): It looks like the possible encodings are exposed as part of the string ABI for Swift: https://forums.swift.org/t/piercing-the-string-veil/21700

DW (chat): But wouldn't the Component Model Scope unnecessarily disallow a language like AssemblyScript, that is deliberately like JavaScript to aid interop, to exchange its strings unchanged?

ZN (chat): ​​if you have a second string type, won't there be a signature mismatch? (when a component not using Wobbly is linked with a component using Wobbly)

CW (chat): that would be the “link-time error” scenario Luke mentioned - the other option would be implicit casts

DW (chat): We could make linking domstring to usvstring a warning falling back to replacement, if there are concerns about erroring. I think people would be fine with that. 

DW(chat): Isn't AssemblyScript <-> JavaScript a real world use case?

AvK (chat): It is a use case, but it doesn’t necessitate unpaired surrogates to be successful.

DD (chat): The "use your own internal ABI inside your component" slide gave one example of how

DW (chat): But isn't that unnecessary and could be easily supported?

KM (chat): Do we have any data about how much overhead copying strings eagerly has? Vs the “lazy” JS approach due to immutability

NF (chat): I don't personally have data, but it seems irrelevant to me bc the lazy approach is unavailable for wasm because linear memory is mutable, unlike js strings

TS (chat): we can't do lazy copying anyway, at least in cases where one side uses linear memory

DW (chat): It sounds like we cannot guarantee that unpaired surrogates don't lead to problems. Why are we voting on having a "single" list-of-USV abstraction? Wouldn't we have a separate poll anyhow?

KM (chat): Well, in theory we could have something like a primitive “gc” type for strings. Since you can’t have cycles it doesn’t actually have to be garbage collected e.g. you could use ref counting.

<LW is finished presenting. DS summarizing questions in chat>

DS: There is a summary of concerns here (https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/135#issuecomment-890743678) Would anyone like to elaborate on those points, or talk more about this?

DW (chat): I would like to make a case for a separate domstring :)

DW (chat): Yeah, my microphone is broken somehow, really bad timing :(

DS: DW asks in chat “Why are we voting on having a "single" list-of-USV abstraction? Wouldn't we have a separate poll anyhow?”. The “single abstraction" poll is to start with a single type, in the IT MVP. The thing we are trying to do with separate polls is to ask the community for a signal. Anything can be added later, particularly if we get real-world experience. 

DW (chat): I can also offer to do some of the legwork for domstring if there is interest.

CW (chat): There is interest, although most naturally at a different layer of abstraction from the general component model

TS: sounds like we cannot guarantee that unpaired surrogates don’t lead to problems. We rarely can guarantee something on the Web Platform. Any addition of a builtin method can cause problems. Always possible to demonstrate a piece of code that can be broken if it was in the wild. That cannot be the bar. The bar is: does it cause problems in practice to a large amount of existing content. That is what the standardization body has to figure out. LW expressed this well in talking through the existence of more than one toolchain having the exact proposed semantics here, and not encounter security bugs, whereas we do have security bugs caused by not sanitizing strings. That clears the bar for MVP, practically it is not a problem we need to address right now.

AvK(in chat): Can you type out why we couldn’t do domstring later if needed?

DW (chat): In web standardization there is WebIDL, though, which has both DOMString and USVString for reasons I believe

DW (chat) I think that is a good bar

DD (chat): Reasons which don't apply to wasm, as explained in the presentation.

TT (chat): i think my main question is are interface types string types constrained to USV only at the component boundary, or would we also be constrained to USV inside of components

DW (chat): I also had a code example in my presentation to show what can go wrong, and will likely go wrong on Web scale :)
CW (chat): Definitely only at the component boundary

NF (chat): Thomas, Luke's slides had examples of custom ABIs within a component, eg C family or Ocaml or JVM

TT (chat): so would it be possible to annotate string semantics with IT inside of components?

DW (chat): I think there are many examples of practical errors, for example the JSON proposal linked fixes a roundtrip bug

TT (chat): or just with shared everything?

CW (chat): You could choose to stick to the constraints of IT even within a component

AvK (chat): Yeah, Web IDL’s DOMString is primarily about it targeting JS, doesn’t really apply to cross-lang interop.

CW (chat): But it wouldn’t be necessary

<DS summarizing questions in chat>

RT (chat): how well does a utf-8 copy-and-validate written in wasm perform relative to bulk copy?

DW (chat): My general concern is that disallowing WTF-16 languages (Java, C#, JS, AS by extension, Dart, who cannot really change) to exchange their idomatic strings is not only unnecessary, but can (and most likely will) lead to all sorts of issues, as many issues show. I suggest to allow these languages to exchange their idomatic strings unchanged with each other (while keeping everything else as suggested), one way (integrated into string) or another (separate domstring), so these languages can use this string both internally and externally (like UTF-8 languages can do with string), and the Web embedding can use it as well without risking breakage. We could also make linking domstring to string a link-time warning for the developer for good measure.

TS (chat): it doesn't have to be written in wasm: the runtime would do the validation

DS: One thing to note about the polls: The details of what it means to support UTF-16 changes depending on whether we choose to support only USV-strings or not.

AR: wouldn’t it make more sense to switch the polls around then?

DS: we had some discussion about that in agenda doc, i’m not inclined to do that right now, polls we had in the past have often have similar issues, the exact details of the spec or implementation is determined after the meeting.

KM (chat): @Ross Tate That also seems like a question that can be answered during the MVP. If we have problems with copying then it’s likely any copying will be prohibitive.

DaG (chat): warning vs. error doesn't significantly change the outcomes; either developers will avoid components which cause warnings (fragmentation) or use toolchains which introduce the coersions

BT (chat): I think we should move forward with the poll

NF (chat): does the fetch API, which uses usv string, disallow WTF-16 languages? clearly not

DW (chat): It's really sad I cannot give my presentation :)

DW (chat): I hope everyone has seen the slides, I think this is important

DD (chat): I think everything was addressed in the presentation; moving forward with the poll makes a lot of sense to me.

DW (chat): :(

ZB (chat): For lans like Java, AS & co it would be nice to have built in string, but probably it’s something separate

DG: DW has concern about WTF-16 languages in chat, the presentation doesn’t disallow WTF languages, maybe LW can chime in to address the concerns again.

RT: LW made an argument for semantics, we can have USV as semantics as a start, add more as needed. What are the overhead for adding encoding validation when copying, could be multiple times?

LW: As KM said in the chat, this is something we can profile, and learn from languages in the wild. 

TL: this is open to be revisited once we have users, real applications using this, then we can empirically see that validation is a problem or not. We can revisit as needed.

RT: Sounds good

DS: Agree with TL, one principle used in the past to revisit decisions is when assumptions that don’t hold or we get new information

**POLL**: Poll for supporting [UTF-16](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/136#issuecomment-861799460) lifting and lowering

|SF|F|N|A|SA|
|--|-|-|-|--|
|29|15|6|2|0|

DS: AR, WO are the “against” votes:  anything you want to note, especially that is not already a part of the presentation?

AR: the desire for UTF-16 lowering based on various assumptions about what implementations do, which are probably not what modern implementations do. Think that we don’t have data to decide if it is a valuable optimization.

DD (chat): Fair point, that downgrades me from F to N. (Not that matters much I imagine?)

AvK (chat): (I was also wondering in what way the outcome influences things.)

**POLL**: Poll for maintaining single list-of-USV `string` type

|SF|F|N|A|SA|
|--|-|-|-|--|
|31|8|6|0|2|

DS: dcode, Joe, anything you would like to say?

JP: This could be a hit for JS, maybe we could provide the fastest path possible for JS? Possibly valuable to have more discussions.

DW (chat): This is really bad for AssemblyScript, for the reasons I have presented. Killed by specification. Congrats.

CW (chat): Disagree, especially considering AS accidentally implemented sanitisation already.

DW (chat): Nonsense!

DD (chat) I guess AssemblyScript was dead from September 2020 through June 2021…

DW (chat): Just add a domstring, doesn't harm what's anticipated :(

JP (chat): Please don't use that argument Conrad: if someone already accidentally crashed without a seatbelt, should cars not have seat belts? Hence it is not a great argument.

DW (chat): (lol @Domenic)

DW (chat): Logically invalid. Fallacy.
AT (chat): I think we can encourage a positive tone @dcode @Joe :)

DW (chat): I think positive tone is over.

ZB (chat): For langs like Java, AS & co it would be nice to have built-in string or other ways to have fast/cheap interop with browser API, but probably it’s something separate.

AT (chat): We can figure thigns out back in the AS side of things :)

DW (chat): This is not what the spec is supposed to do.

DW (chat): I could not disagree more with this.

JP (chat): I think both sides are being disrespectful, regardless of the outcome.

DW (chat): You should account for concerns by implementers, not this.

JP (chat): If language match with each other (f.e. JS + AS) why not have the best interface?
Java + C#, Java + JS, etc.

DD (chat): They can use one-off interfaces, but the purpose of standard interop is... standard interop.

JP (chat): Will we want to make separate specs for new interfaces? Seems like more work, and not guaranteed

KM: given the strings have to be copied, the transformation makes more sense. You can choose your behavior as a consumer. You can come back in the future and say, and hope doesn’t preclude data coming back that says some applications have problems under the sanitization world, and reconsider. But at this time it seems reasonable to start here.

TT: I've tried to find a middle ground between both sides. I wonder if it’s possible that inside of a component to have additional interface types that are not language agnostic but can take into account shared encodings between modules.
