### Update on [Typed (Function) References](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references) (Andreas Rossberg) [25 min]

[Presentation](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/main/2021/presentations/2021-10-26-rossberg-func-ref-type.pdf)


KM [on non-defaultable locals]: One possible option is to sidestep the problem - make all mlocals non nullable, and initialize with set. We would need to do a null check after initialization was this considered?

AR: we did discuss that; basically just being the most conservative and not allow non-defaultable locals. It seems like a cop-out, you want to be explicit. References also might not be the only non-defaultable type and maybe you won’t have the option of doing null. RTT for example, reference types weren’t nullable.

KM: You could go back and add this later

CW: There were also some concerns with the  number of as_non_null instructions, some examples had a lot

AR: Also seen my compiler, try to avoid using let instead of nullable locals. When you want to read it or pass it onto a function that uses something non-nullable then you need an additional check

KM: I guess one way to solve would be to leave it on the stack and propagate into your blocks, and pick it out (do we have a pick instruction?)

AR: Doesn’t solve the problem in general, the producer knows it’s not null but has to convince..

KM: I guess you could have a local.get_as_non_null?

AR: You can’t store the information that it’s not null. You want to be able to store something in the additional information that this is not null..

CW: this was just the code size issue could be solved by getting and recording the information at the same time.

KM: Not sure if that’s actually better, let’s carry on

FM: There’s a parallel between non-null and initializing local variables with having data structures that you initialize and want to seal after. The same mechanism should be able to deal with both

AR: I don’t think that’s the case because with data structures, it’s like you forget some type info on a reference (e.g. that it was mutable) but with locals and tables you can’t because their type is global. You can’t really refine the type info.

FM: Yeah, haven’t much put thinking into this

CW: as things are now, I guess we could do something careful with the start function, but if we had first-class tables that wouldn’t work.

AR: Right, the start function right now is orthogonal to typing, and may create some weird entanglement

AT<chat>Igalia has been working on an impl in JSC as well, with most instructions implemented now

LH: on tooling. Do we have tools that use this yet? Are they using it independent of the GC proposal?

TL: Binaryen supports it, but don’t know of anything using it independently.

AR: I don’t know of any either.

LH: Just thinking about what the general priority is

AR: Good question, GC proposal is the obvious proposal, and where it originated. There was a thing that it was motivated by WASI using function references for some things. But not sure if that’s the case anymore, can’t recall other other major motivations

LW: do you mean func.bind or references generally?

LH: Non-nullable references in general

LW: I don't remember any WASI connection on func refs. Maybe the thing was getting typed tables and typed dispatch in those

AR: Typed tables would be good to do to get rid of the type check. Do we think Emscripten/LLVM would make use of that?

LH: do we think emscripten/llvm will make use of that?

DS: might, have talked about using it for vtables, cfi, not strong plans for that

LW: Am.js had typed tables, the FCI cases is great can do analysis on class hierarchy and could do meaningful things

RT: was just wondering also if we should pull it back into the GC. Do we have evidence that typed tables would improve performance?

LW: We saw regressions from moving asm.js typed tables to wasm

AZ: it would also allow better dead code elimination.

JK: re non-defaultable locals, I thought there was interest in exploring control-flow aware tracking first, e.g. if/else initialize locals in both branches, and propagate to the join afterwards

AR: Don’t remember any intent of experimentation with that, if we wanted to do that it should be through block types, we concluded that this would be a conservative and an extension we can add later

JK: IIRC, Aske reported that it would save some instructions

CW: He suggested that there wasn’t much flow based initialized, so wasn’t clear that we would get anything at all

AZ: Tools perspective flow based would be easiest to implement, don’t know how hard block based would be to implement

AR: you have to match flow-based rules from Wasm exactly, that’s kind of the slippery slope there, not convinced that it is actually simpler to do with

RT: You have to do that with blocks anyway, aske also said there were some issues on the generation side if it doesn’t fall into the convenient path

JK: have had it on my to-do list but haven’t got to it

AZ: I hope we do try out trapping at runtime semantically if a non-nullable value is used with a nullable value, should be simpler to implement in the tools

AR: from my POV this solution is equivalent to not allowing non-defaultable, force everyone to use nullable one, combined with the idea that a special local.get that does null check. Not a big fan of this. Local.get should be a register read, no runtime check.

AT: Quick question about JS API, Igalia working on implementing this in JSC. What is the plan in the JS API to create .global and specify a funcref? That is the plan there? 

AR: good question. If we want to allow that then we do need to extend the API. I’m not sure what the value of that would be exactly. In JS you can’t enforce these types, so you’d have to check at the boundary anyway.

CW: What would it look like on the JS side? 

AR: have to cast it, first you have to import it with some concrete Wasm type. From Wasm perspective there are no JS functions, only host functions that wrap JS, which always have some concrete types

CW: If you export the wasm table to JS, what would it looks like? 

AR: API doesn’t allow you to put a function in the table, fixing with the js-types proposal - in MVP you can’t actually do that

CW: Should this be a dependency on that proposal?

AR: Open question whether that dependency should be introduces, not sure how it would be used. Haven’t heard anyone express a need for this

HA: If the validation from local.get is a problem, would it be a solution to introduce another non-local get, and only use the one that needs validation for the ones that need to be non-nullable?

AR: won’t save much, since you have to make the case distinction if the local is defaultable or not, still have an extra branch i think. Also don’t save overhead with block ends where you have to undo the information (or figure out if if you have to undo)

JK: Good idea, if we want to get rif of the validation cost, not sure if it’s worth it, but it does give us the option

AR: the one that requires a defaultable one will have to check too

JK: That’s a status quo, not a regression

AR: currently you don’t need that in the MVP

JK: have to look at the code, remember seeing the code, you’re right in theory you don’t need it, we have it for local def, but not for local get

CW: Might also be an argument in favor of local.init talked about earlier

JK: local.get is the problem, not local.init

AR: End is also in the same ball park. 

AR: we should try to resolve this, have been stuck on this issue for a while

AT [chat]: Thanks for the answer re: JS API. I agree it makes sense to connect it to type reflection. There’s also this issue that with type reflection implemented you need some representation either way when you query an exported typed funcref global, even if perhaps you can’t construct these from JS.

AR [chat]: Yes, good point.

### Update on [Custom Annotations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/annotations/) (Andreas Rossberg) [15 min]

(Postponed to next meeting)

### Update on CSP integration (Francis McCabe) [15 min]

[TODO: slides]

AR: how does this affect the JS API? Rather than just Web API?

FM: we had to add a constraint. Webassembly.compile with  bytes is in the JS api and compile response is in the web API, and they both need adjusting.

DS: Poll for phase 2, not sure if people have opinion if we should go for phase 3?

DG: we also have a full web platform test suite, which covers that requirement, which is the big one for phase 3. So I don’t think that would be unreasonable.

DS: a lot of the changes that usually happen in phase 2 has already happened on the WebAppSec side, comfortable with phase 3 in this case.

Poll for phase 3
SF: 8
F: 12
N: 4
A: 0
SA: 0

CSP advances to phase 3, congratulations!
