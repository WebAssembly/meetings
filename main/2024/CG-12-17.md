### Proposals and discussions

#### How to plan out an engine API for dynamically-instrumenting a WebAssembly application.
If interested, fill this out: https://forms.gle/AeFTsHEsdv5kKnX88

EG: Working with Ben Titzer, considering an API for dynamic instrumentation for wasm. Interested in hearing if there’s a broader community interested in what the API would look like. Wondering if it would make sense have an interest group

FM: Can you elaborate on the use case?

EG: dynamically instrument modules without injecting more bytecode or rewriting it. So you’d express your instrumentation in terms of a wasm module and the engine would manage that and inject probe callbacks for you. Events could be down to bytecode granularity, function entry/exit,  GC operations, etc. a way to express instrumentation in a way that’s not tied to the application itself.

DS: A few years ago Rich Winterton proposed "Instrumenting and tracing technology," which sounded similar. Might want to track him down.

[AB, in chat: Here is Rich's original proposal for instrumentation: https://github.com/WebAssembly/instrument-tracing]

BT: IIRC he was proposing toggling some hardware tracing that’s found in Intel chips.
For more background, see also Elizabeth' s talk at WasmCon. This is more of a discussion about appetite for this, talking to engine implementors, use cases beyond research engines.

TL: from the web perspective, I’m not sure we’d want to ship this to end users on the web, but it could be useful as a browser extension or something. You mentioned bytecode rewriting: is it possible to polyfill your observability API by bytecode rewriting?

EG: yes you could do that, at least for events that are observable. But for non-observable events, no. There are different use cases. Part of the presentation is about a DSL that would let you do either. It would be good to get perspectives of end users instead of just research.

CW: I could see use cases for embedded world, for on-device debugger or in-situ monitoring of software. You could turn on observability or metrics collection. We also have people trying to solve AOT debugging problems on embedded systems, it’s a similar space, we can connect you. We can probably give feedback from the embedded side. Also don’t forget the embedded SIG, there might be interest there.

ABK: At Dfinity we do a lot of bytecode rewriting and it causes a bunch of problems. We would be interested in this.

EG: yeah, we were thinking if you had a system API you could of course do it in a local debugging session, but if you could dynamically enable and disable tracing in production, it would be really useful for debugging production issues.

JK (chat): Chris would you still have an appetite for this if it came with a significant performance cost?

CW: maybe; that’s a good question. That’s the problem if you observe it and it changes the behavior, it makes it hard.

TL: Is there typically a large perf cost?

EG: part of the goal is to make it more performant. There are tricks you can do with JIT/ interpreter intrinsifications. If you can know some characteristics of what the instrumentation callback needs, there are some tricks you can do . Obviously there's always some cost due to extra operations but we’ve found it pretty good for some simple instrumentation code.

DS: I'm optimistic you could do pretty well. I don't know if you're familiar with the Pin tool from Intel, but it performs surprisingly well.

DG: Your agenda item said you were interested in some kind of interest group, how did you imagine this discussion continuing?

EH: honestly don’t know, I was looking for feedback. Does this sound like a WASI interface, some kind of new SIG that turns into a WASI interface? Not sure

TL: structure-wise, we have the full CG, subgroups. In theory we could spin up some kind of new structure, but for simplicity its probably easier to not formally define a new kind of thing, but maybe it make sense to keep it totally informal, or spin up a subgroup if you do want it to be affiliated with the CG and eventually produce specifications have the IPR protections for the CG. If you want to spin up a subgroup, wed need the CG charter to cover the use case. For now If i were you, since there’s no concrete standards proposal that you’re working on, maybe keeping it an informal meeting might be easiest.

DG: I asked because I know we had the debugging subgroups, there could be some overlap there. That could possibly be a framework if you want to go more formal after you have some discussions. I’ll leave my email in the notes and you can contact me and I’ll add you.

ZB (chat): I, as a producer of wasm binaries and user of wasm VMs, am interested in such a capability in VMs, including web VMs. Is the debugging group still functional?

DS: Not really, but it could be rebooted for this use case since it is already a chartered subgroup.

BT: TL asked about polyfilling. I think it’s doable up to a point, there’s monkey patching in JS etc. you basically have to intercept all wasm that goes into the engine and rewrite bytecode. For polyfills you can probably offer most functionality but probably not all of it.

TL: makes sense. Personally I’m very interested to use whatever comes out of this, just for informal debugging, it seems generally useful.

EG: Here is my email, please reach out if you are interested in attending meetings on this: evgilber@andrew.cmu.edu

ZB (chat): @evgilber@andrew.cmu.edu , @Benjamin Titzer it might be simpler if you create and share a (google) form to gather interested parties.

EG (chat): For those interested in dynamic instrumentation for Wasm, fill out this form! https://forms.gle/AeFTsHEsdv5kKnX88

####  Presentation of [static memory protection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory-control/blob/main/proposals/memory-control/static-protection.md) from the [Memory Control](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory-control/) proposal

BV: Presenting ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UC6Vmq02-B-GQCflxdJ8f3uHqc3xPj5Ok11cjUe4xBs/edit?usp=sharing))

A simple form of memory protection that we think could fit in with relatively low cost.

AR: question: when we say nullptrs don’t trap, that assumes a choice by the compiler. The C compiler can compile it to point to -1 or something. The value of NULL could be anything

KW (chat): My understanding was that LLVM generally makes sure that calls to null function pointers do trap, by starting to populate the funcref table at 1.

NF (chat): yep, what isn't caught by default is reading/writing data through a null pointer

BV: In principle, yes, a toolchain could work around this. But even then, 0 is probably still going to be the most common value.

Security slide

MF (chat): FYI there's a Stage 2 TC39 proposal for immutable ArrayBuffers, which may help with the JS integration for this feature: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-immutable-arraybuffer. But probably only if the design marked a whole memory as read-only.

DG (chat): IMO this proposal could still work in a reasonable way with this proposal, because you can't mix protections when exposing to JS. This proposal in several sub proposals assume that you would have to decouple the backing store with the JSArrayBuffer, so I could see a future JS API index translate and expose the read/write portion, but expose the read-only section as an immutable-buffer

TL (chat): Do you mean this sub-proposal could still work well in the full memory control proposal?

MF (chat): so back the memory with 2 (or 3?) separate ArrayBuffers?

KW: Is the rationale for making it static really just about performance?

BV: making it possible to implement efficient protection when using bounds checks

KW: That’s a benefit of knowing AOT vs having it in a register?

BV: yes we think so but don’t have numbers.

RH: I think the cost of a static lower bound is a subtract and a const vs another load. If you can grow the RO region, it shifts the RW region and that affects bounds check elimination and optimizations. That’s the rationale for not growing the RO region.

NF (chat): the benefit is the single contiguous ranges, rather than having to implement an MMU in software, which is what would be required for arbitrary ranges of protections across memories.

KW (chat): Single contiguous range seems fine, but that seems orthogonal to the question of putting it in the module structure and making it static. This seems to have a lot of similarities (and similar weaknesses) to my "cap" alternative to the custom-page-sizes proposal that was... not popular.

AR: not being able to grow the RO region makes sense. But i’m concerned about initialization. I think your 3rd suggestion about not bothering, isn’t going to be good. In wasm 2 active segments are sugar for memory init. We could relax that but it’s hard to specify them as static, e.g. vtables are often cyclic, but you still want the protection. I think you still want something more flexible. The only thing I can think of is something that flips the bit and turns the protection on. That obviously add more complexity  but I don’t really see a good alternative.

BV: Don't quite understand the cyclic aspect. Can you explain?

AR if you need to allocate something and don’t know…

BV: My perspective is that for use cases where active data segments already suffice fit nicely into this model, which is a pretty good chunk of Wasm use in the wild, e.g. interned string constants. There are things that don't/ but there’s a lot of use cases that do fit

AR: one of your arguments is to protect against control flow attacks e.g. vtables, but I don’t think that will work and I think that’s an important use case that we want to cover. For cases with cycle structure, you usually have to use some form of backpatching. Because you don’t really know fhte offsets from the beginning

TL: The way static linking works for LLVM tools is that the link is offline, all the backpatching happens offline. By the time you load, the pointers are constants. The vtable could go into RO memory. This scheme would work for those C-like languages. As long as no dynamic linking

DG: A lot of memory control is hard to work with without an MMU. Is the goal for the static subset here consistency with embedded engines? I would be curious to know from the embedded folks whether they would use this, since otherwise you could do something more general with an MMU.

BV: I'd be curious to know too, it’s intended to support a variety of use cases. It was also clear that many hosts that do have an MMU don’t want module changing page protections at runtime because of the cost of that, especially with multiple cores.

RH: also: it’s not just MMU, you also need signal handling. And if you hand this memory anywhere else in the VM, you might trap in memcpy or elsewhere, so being able to fall back to a bounds check in addition to signal handling is nice for VMs. shifting away from that would be a lot of engineering work in browsers.

BV: it’s good for the plugin use case too.

DG: I agree with that, but we should dig into the motivation. Do we need to provide protection at all? Does this fit the use cases we're designing for in this space.

CW: In Pittsburgh there was a big push, we got together with the embedded stakeholders and thought about the HW specification, when you look at the HW, it’s pretty hard to find something with no memory controller at all. Most things that can run Wasm have it. Most have full MMUs, so for the scenarios where we need to share memory and need advanced HW support in the embedded world, probably we’d just buy chips that have that capability. So there probably isn’t too much hardware where there’s no memory management support at all. We put together a HW spec that can be used as a baseline, and they have some form of memory control unit.  If the cost is a concern, we would configure the memory protections at startup and then shut it down.

BV: That’s good to know. I do think that the signal h handling situation that RH talked about still makes it hard to design around signals in a lot of use cases. And that’s still a motivator

LW (chat): +1 to Ben’s point; high-concurrency page-table mutation can be prohibitively expensive on multi-core.

BT: To address Andreas's point about cyclic initialization being hard, I think this design is meant to match existing formats, so this isn't really a problem. For shadow stack memory, my understanding is that shadow stacks are typically at the bottom of the memory so you catch overflows?

BV: Yeah you could put it at the bottom of RW memory, then you’d catch bad writes but not reads. But not quite as good

Dan Gohman (chat): For shadow stacks, trapping on writes is sufficient because one never reads before writing in a new stack frame.

MB: Also to address Andreas's point, you could keep it cheap at the expense of making this a much bigger proposal. You would need a parallel set of initialize-only read and write instructions. They only do anything when the initialization bit is set and other read/write operations would always respect the protections.

BV: FWIW I can also imagine other ways to complicate instantiation to support more interesting use cases, e.g. explicit phases.

SC: as stated this seems nice for the Emscripten use case. Also for tables, C++ would be great with RO tables, it would also enable optimizers like Binaryen to do more optimizations if it knows the tables are RO.  in terms of init, basically all C++ programs use active data segments

BT(chat): With read-only memory regions, partial evaluation of interpreters to read-only bytecode could be made sound too :-)

CF (chat): Yes, absolutely, I would use this in weval if it existed!

DS: An unrelated use case for null-permission memory if you could also get an exception rather than a trap: Null pointer exceptions. Java and Kotlin have asked for this, for example.

BV: I would like for a protection scheme for Wasm to keep those possibilities open.

BT: It’s worthwhile to point out that languages that have null checks have them explicitly which is a size and performance cost.

DG: on the security bit: memory corruption is hard to catch with specific schemes, there was a blog post recently on V8, a lot of how we are dealing with this is with the V8 sandbox (link: https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox).
From the chrome perspective, it’s hard for us to justify  making invasive changes to the memory setup for ergonomic wins, I’m not sure we can justify working on this kind of scheme right now.

AC (chat): Is the goal to spin out this presentation into its own proposal outside of memory-control?

BV: Don't want to spin it out any time soon. We want to make sure we have a coherent set of memory control features rather than have a bunch of unrelated features. Having said that, this is nice because it doesn’t require a new mode like some MC proposals have.
