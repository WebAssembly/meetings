## Agenda items

1. Opening
1. Proposals and discussions
   1. Discuss how to plan out an engine API for dynamically-instrumenting a WebAssembly application. Like [`JVMTI`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#whatIs) for Wasm. This was [briefly discussed](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-observe/discussions/19) with the `wasi-observe` group, but the idea doesn't fit into their goals. Should we make a new interest group?
