### Discussion

#### Vote to advance Tail Call, Extended Constant Expressions, Typed Function References, Garbage Collection, Multiple Memories, Relaxed SIMD, Custom Annotations, and Branch Hinting to Phase 5.

Threads is the only one missing from the list of phase 4 proposals. It has several open issue in the spec, and not really ready for merging into the spec

AR: most of the other proposals, except maybe for relaxed SIMD are merged into the wasm-3.0 branch in the spec repo. The current version of SpecTec is based on that branch, so it contains all those proposals.
Branch hinting won’t end up in the main core spec. The plan is a separate document for that.

DS: The CR publication advancement is announced,  just waiting for the 2 weeks to expire.

AR: will that involve some more steps? Do we have to make some other cut of the current document?

DS: I don’t think so? I think that whatever we push to the W3C TR URL is officially the CR

AR: I have a branch where I did some minor changes to build/CI but haven’t pushed because we have to wait for the change. Now I’m forgetting exactly what the change was.

DS: maybe the bikeshed change from making it an “editor’s draft” or WD to CR?

AR: yes, I think that was it. Change from draft to CR. I will make a PR out of it to show.
There also have been a bunch of minor spec fixes lately which should also be included automatically.
The PR is pretty minor, will be part of the process on our end. Hard to test since it’s CI. It pushes it to the W3C TR directory. IIRC that’s also the place where the CR goes

DS: After the 2 weeks is up, I’ll check with Mike to clarify.

Let’s do the vote:
Vote to advance Tail Call, Extended Constant Expressions, Typed Function References, Garbage Collection, Multiple Memories, Relaxed SIMD, Custom Annotations, and Branch Hinting to Phase 5.

|SF|F|N|A|SA|
|--|-|-|-|--|
|4|1|0|0|0|

Vote passes.

AR: any updates from the other 2 proposals we’re waiting on, EH and memory64?

DS: EH is on the CG agenda for phase 4 next week. We have the JS API tests that we discussed in Pittsburg. Memory64 is waiting for Firefox to finish the table64 implementation, plus whatever open spec issues there are.

AR: spec is basically done, the one open question is about Bigint in the JS API. Maybe the conservative option for now is not to allow bigint, should be enough for the foreseeable future.
On EH tests: one thing I noted when I implemented the core tests to the new version of the proposal is that the coverage seems a little low. Does anyone own improving that?

DS: nobody is on the hook for that right now, I can check and see if there are any V8 tests we can bring over.

AR: what about the JS API?

DS: It’s in OK shape. It covers the way we use it in emscripten, plus some reference-related stuff, plus coverage of the constructors and other JS-specific stuff

AR: I guess there was also the question about the type method. What’s up with the type reflection? Proposal? I think it’s the last of the original first generation of extensions we discussed.

DS: Nominally Ilya still owns that; we don’t really have users asking for it or known use cases, so I think it just didn’t get prioritized.

TL: what’s the latest thinking for spectec transition? Any plans or timeline?

AR: We had a group meeting at PLDI, Sukyoung was there with a bunch of students, and Conrad, me and Sam. We have regular meetings to push it forward, we made a list of packages and priorities to work on. Most of the items are on their end right now, they expect to make progress in the summer. I have a list of smaller TODOs, missing spec bits but the bigger part is polishing the prose and making the user experience with the prose backend and interpreter better. My plan was to target something like november to bring it back to the CG, I’m hoping to get it done by the end of the year.

TL: so the plan is to get the spec doc into shape and then bring it to the CG?

AR: right, we should plan on some amount of iteration on that. From the presentation i gave, the boxes are checked except for the prose part, and the things I said wouldn’t be done in the first go (e.g. numerics). The text format needs a little thinking to make it more precise. Thought about numerics a bit too, that’s hard because it requires real numbers. Looked at a library with bigints and big rationals. Everything in wasm except for sqrt is actually rational; so was thinking about rationals for that plus an approximation for sqrt. Not sure how slow that would be, e.g. for huge exponents. But speed doesn’t matter much for the reference interpreter
