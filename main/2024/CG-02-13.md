### Proposals and discussions
#### Discussion of proposed June CMU in-person CG meeting (20 mins; Ben Titzer)


BT: presenting

TC39 is an important constraint for discussion of shared everything (important to get input from some relevant JS experts).
The Web Engines hackfest is 3-5 not 5-7

June 4-6 can be made to work for most people but not everyone.
Itâ€™s the last week of the academic year for some, and there is a hard constraint for one person. Ben will investigate on the CMU side whether other months would work. Previously it was indicated that June would be good (being immediately after the end of the semester, students would be around but done with classes).
