### Proposals and discussions

#### Announcement: last call for f2f registration, agenda proposals, and scheduling constraints

TL: [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqMDs4Y0uT5ngde6SqY19Dnz9FLxKhNsBLVSzK_QyOwlZuvQ/viewform) by May 24. Submit agenda items and schedule constraints via PR to the meetings repo.

##### Discussion of [the `custom-page-sizes` proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-page-sizes) and vote for phase 2 (Nick Fitzgerald, 30 minutes)

NF presenting slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fVhVzeU1iPcyTbnZuehBAQp7aVk3o3EZ_gHaOGf7_dI/edit

PP: This approach disables guard pages, and that's why you have to do bounds checks? There would be a performance impact.

NF: virtual memory guard pages are never guaranteed, for example if there is not enough virtual memory.

AR: Also 32-bit systems can't use that.

NF: Nor can targets without an MMU.

KW (chat): 
My opinion (as somebody who's working on wasm for very constrained embedded environments, with Siemens) is still that a "byte-granularity deterministic cap" would be a lot simpler for the consumer to implement, and would require a much smaller spec change (all things considered), especially when you consider changes to the tools conventions, and would hit all the important use cases. I appreciate the new slide on that option here but... I guess I just have a different point of view. It's true that memory.size would no longer return the maximum writable address, but... there's no runtime mechanism to get the memory limits today either.

BV (chat): How does a 1-byte page size differ from a "byte-granularity deterministic cap"?

KW (chat): it wouldn't change the behavior of memory.grow or the object format at all. Or to be clearer: the current proposal changes the execution of memory.size, memory.grow, and the tools conventions (__builtin_wasm_page_size and new linker behavior). A "byte-granularity deterministic cap" would be much dumber -- it wouldn't change any of those three things. It would just impose a requirement for the consumer to trap on loads and stores to addresses > the cap. My understanding from the last meeting was that we were going to discuss this on an issue thread -- but there hasn't been one on this topic yet. I'm sorry to be applying stop energy in these meetings.

AK: You mentioned that some engines have shipped the non-standard solution. It's odd that the proposal is coming from a different group. Do we have assurance that the engines shipping today will adopt the standard proposal?

NF: We're setting up an interest group in the bytecode alliance. Also there is no standard solution for this problem right now. The engines would follow the standard if they could.

CW: Don't want to hang up the poll on endless rounds of requesting feedback for more people. Nick, have you reached out to the engine implementers?

NF: Yes, I've reached out in meetings, on GitHub, to implementers, etc. I could always do more, but unclear where to draw the line.

AK: Want to avoid the situation where we adopt the proposal, but then the intended audience doesn't use it.

NF: Even if the non-standard thing has usage for a while, having a standard solution is a benefit in itself.

TL: What if we vote on the page size question, then separately discuss the issue KW raised further on GitHub.

BT: Is there time pressure? Seems an ecosystem risk.

CW: Let's move ahead with this poll and do a straw poll for phase 2 to see where we stand.

Poll: (if we proceed with multiple page sizes) there shall be two valid page sizes (1 byte and 64KiB), factored to be potentially extended in the future.

SF: 11
F: 17
N: 9
A: 0
SA: 0

Straw poll: Do we want to move forward with the multiple page sizes?

MP (for) : 15
N (neutral): 14
A (consider an alternative): 4

KW to take the action item to file an issue for further discussion.

#### Discussion: To keep or remove [@name annotations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/annotations/issues/21) (Thomas Lively, 30 minutes)

TL presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a8ihfu9knCN9srCWFreb0E6JHmFwDnCsdvFD-YevKpI/edit?usp=sharing)

FM: Overloaded functions.

TL: But would anyone actually use them?

AR: Another dimension. Also allows multiple names on a single item. Names are in the domain of the source language, but symbolic identifiers are not. Also want to have text versions of all binary custom sections. Would be weird if only standard custom section doesn't have annotation. Workaround with @ custom annotation requires knowledge of binary encoding, etc. so not useful in text format.

YI: There is a bit of work to be done if we remove the name section. Tests, etc. Is the annotations proposal the best place for the extended identifiers?

AR: I'm ok with adding the extended identifiers, it's close enough.

BV: What's the connection between binary and text?

AR: The idea is that it gives custom binary sections corresponding text formats.

BV: I'm not sure I see the value of having it be human-editable.

AR: I don't know, people do various things with the text format. If it's not editable, I think it's value is diminished.

TL: Are there other tools that support the name annotations? Binaryen does not, and if I can't implement it before the phase 4 vote at the f2f, is that going to be a procedural issue? It's up to us.

AC (chat): wasm-tools has support for @name annotations.

TL: Great, no issue then. Seems like we have consensus to keep the name annotations.
