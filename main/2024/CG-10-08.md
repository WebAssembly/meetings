### Proposals and discussions

1. Update on and (possible) phase 2 vote for [128-bit-arithmetic](https://github.com/WebAssembly/128-bit-arithmetic) (Alex Crichton) 

AC: presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K8Dq7EHfUDuaGmA4JiiltNCHEgNf8S5i0cs5sKcdjsQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Discussion:

BH (chat): Thank you for the overview!

ZB(chat) : nice overview

RH(chat): Agree, thanks for the thorough walk through of the possibilities here.

LW(chat): Great analysis of the alternatives

HD: high level question: is there a reason you didn't go for FP128?

AC: it was unrelated to the original motivation

HD: in the scientific world, higher precision FP are important and could help for portability of scientific code. 

AC: I’m not very familiar with that world, i’m not sure I would be a good person to push that forward.

HD: I think this is still good for what it’s for.

Poll to advance to phase 2 and rename to “wide-arithmetic”
SF: 14
F: 16
N: 1
A: 0
SA: 0

JK (chat):
big +1 to mul_wide_{s,u} instead of mul128.
I'm still not sold on add128 being superior to add_with_carry, but (1) I'm also not sure it's worse, and (2) we can continue that conversation elsewhere :-)
