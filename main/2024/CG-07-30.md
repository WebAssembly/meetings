### Proposals and discussions

#### Update on and phase 2 vote for the custom-page-sizes proposal (Nick Fitzgerald, 30 minutes)

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRUhkw44C4ZAXaEUMa7fSo8jcs1hzjWk78ocyu9W69O5zI2Z-7fH7WzZVWBBMOq3aLmTi8loBX1lUfj/pub?start=false&loop=false

NF presenting

FM: Not related to this, but  Is there any similar thought about how to manage maximum sizes of GC memories?

NF: That has not come up in this proposal. From wasmtime perspective I assume this would be a knob for the runtime to expose to the embedder, since all allocation can nondeterministically fail and kill the program, so it’s not really visible to the guest program, since it wouldn’t really know. On the web I guess you can throw an OOM exception

PP: Have you heard any implementation interest from the web?

NF: it would be nice in the fullness of time. There are cool tools that could be built for emulating or virtualizing embedded devices, e.g. emulating a phone, with the same settings as the device. It would be nice, I hope they will do it eventually, but I understand it’s not a priority for them at the moment.

CW: I remember a discussion where web developers on phones were bumping into virtual memory limits. Can anyone here speak to that?

RH: In spider monkey we ran into some virtual memory limitations. We try to detect that early now, and fall back to bounds checking. So we try to address it without any spec changes.

BV: IIUC, before that change we were reserving lots of address space. It wasn’t that big pages were causing issues, it was the reservation strategy.

RH: Yeah it was a memory reservation strategy that we tried to avoid bounds checks. So we avoid that implementation technique if we have to.

PP: I’m open to being the only dissent here, but some of the motivation when this was presented was for extremely constrained devices without virtual memory, but the alternative presented was tabled because we couldn’t support virtual memory, and didn’t serve the purpose well.

CW: I think once we hashed out the technical concerns around the alternative proposals, it didn’t seem like there was much between them, so I went with what I thought was the cleaner language design.

PD: On the size of how many bytes i can choose: is it fixed to 4k or can i say e.g. 100 bytes?

NF: You can do any 32-bit amount of bytes.

PD: So only the page size is fixed.

NF: Right, the page size is fixed but you can specify any number of pages. So you can ask for 8192 pages of 1 byte.

PD: I like that, it would be a useful feature for my use case.

CW: let’s do a full poll:

|SF|F|N|A|SA|
|--|-|-|-|--|
|12|19|6|1|0|

CW: Any final comments PP as the against vote?

PP: I disagree that the consensus was reached, as the alternative to the current design was rejected in order to support virtual memory, while the motivation for the proposal is to support devices without virtual memory. Up to the chairs to determine consensus though.

CW: Given the results of the poll, we’ve achieved consensus for phase 2. PP, if you continue to have concerns about the proposal, please keep raising them and we’ll take them into account as the proposal continues to move through the process
