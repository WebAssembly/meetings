### Proposed agenda items (to be scheduled if time permits)
Use this space to add any agenda items that need to be scheduled, and scheduling constraints here, especially if you're not able to travel, but would like to contribute to one of the agenda items. If you are adding a scheduling constraint, add the agenda item you are interested in attending, and timeslots that would work.
Adding a constraint doesn't guarantee that we will be able to accommodate it, but we will attempt to make sure interested folks can attend and contribute.
