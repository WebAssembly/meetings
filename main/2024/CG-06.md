### Proposed agenda items (to be scheduled if time permits)
Use this space to add any agenda items that need to be scheduled, and scheduling constraints here, especially if you're not able to travel, but would like to contribute to one of the agenda items. If you are adding a scheduling constraint, add the agenda item you are interested in attending, and timeslots that would work.
Adding a constraint doesn't guarantee that we will be able to accommodate it, but we will attempt to make sure interested folks can attend and contribute. 

#### Sorting out repos
Most proposals spend most of their time before the stage where formal spec text needs to be written. Especially combined with proposals that have dependency on other proposals, this leads to a poor experience for proposal champions. I would like to open a discussion for better ways of working.

Two ideas: adopt a 'mono-repo' methodology (which would depend on tooling supporting if-defs and flags); and/or split the repo into multiple repos (one for proposal overviews, one for spec, one for the reference interpreter and possibly spec tests)
