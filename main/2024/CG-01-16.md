RH Presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gbyQz0nbLJJ07lbi8iuLHSchQ2-fH29UXS5ebLnG0ZU/edit#slide=id.g1ef40614c6f_0_21)

AK: on WTF-8: It's unclear whether this is something we’ll need in the medium/longterm,but agree it makes sense not to have wasm be the place where we define this, so from spec maintenance perspective it makes sense, and based on talking to users, there doesn’t seem to be immediate need, but we’d like to hear from anyone who does know of a particular need.

RH: If we needed to add it at a later point, in terms of other proposals we’ve done non-trivial changes before. We have consensus on the core parts of the proposal

DG: Can pause to see if anyone has concerns about moving forward to phase 2?

<none>

DG: since phase 2 requirements are higher, we can do a full poll

|SF|F|N|A|SA|
|--|-|-|-|--|
|17|11|4|0|0|

Consensus is reached to move to phase 2.
