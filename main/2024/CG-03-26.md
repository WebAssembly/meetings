### Discuss adding table64 to memory64 proposal: https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64/issues/46 (Sam Clegg, 10 minutes)

SC: Memory64 proposal is almost 4 years old, trying to get it to Phase 4, spec text in progress, the only outstanding issue is table64, should we extend the proposal to include 64-bit indices for memories and tables?

Nobody wants to have more than 4 billion table entries, so it's just for parity with pointer size. The downside is that it's more work to add this. E.g. call_indirect and other instructions need changes.

No strong opinions on the issue, would delay the proposal a bit. Would like to discuss and come to an agreement here.

CW: I imagine the world where the table indices stay 32-bit and we just mask the upper 32-bits is the one we’re in now - is that bad?

SC: That's the status quo. LLVM will truncate pointers. Requires a little more complexity and code size. If we make the change, we could simplify the tools and reduce instruction count, but then engines would have to deal with it instead.

AR: Do you have a better understanding if the usecase that Mathias has for this? They implemented a somewhat weird Wasm producer/consumer - they didn’t want to do the masking because that reduces the confidence of what you’re calling in terms of function pointers, and they implemented manual boundchecks for the function boundaries which was expensive

SC: His use case isn’t a conformant wasm implementation, basically he’s trying to erase the wasm sandbox and use an OS sandbox, using wasm2c to generate not-quite valid wasm which doesn’t use features such as bounds checks. 

The masking can lead to more bugs going unnoticed because pointer corruption in the high bits will be masked out instead of causing problems.

RH: implementing 64 bit bounds checking on tables: on a 64 bit host system a bounds check on the table, shouldn’t be any extra overhead. On a 32-bit system it will be harder, but it’s already harder to do 64-bit memory on 32-bit systems.

If you are on 64-bit system and the engine can do the bounds check for you, then the masking would be wasted work, so there's a performance motivation for not requiring masking.

SC: The feedback we got from V8 was also that it would be a few days of work not more

NF: would this add an index type to the table, or would it just be 64-bit indexes for tables?

SC: It would mirror what we have for memories, it would add 64-bit indices for tables. LLVM would generate both a 64-bit memory and 64-bit table in wasm64 mode.

AR: the other advantage on a meta-level is that it reduce the asymmetry we have between tables and memories, which is nice.

SC: In the spec interpreter, this would reduce the special casing to account for differences between memories and tables.

I would be interested if anyone on the engine side knows if those truncations can be elided. E.g if you mask in the user code and then call_indirect?

DanG: You don't need a mask because x86 can just fold it into the addressing.

SC: We embed an i64.wrap instruction

DanG: You could do an optimization on the engine, and just generate the instruction for accessing the lower 32-bits of the register

CW: you’d have to do a fusing optimization in the engine, right?

DanG: yes you’d pattern match that.

SC: yes, there’s a small binary size increase from the userspace masking with table32 that would go away.

DanG: Doesn't seem well-motivated. Extra surface area to fuzz forever. I would want to see a stronger motivation.

CW: i do see that we don’t have an explicit poll for this on the agenda. How were you thinking we’d move forward?

CW: For a informal poll, we can use the github emojis for getting a sense for how to move forward, it is a normative change so we should eventually poll and announce this ahead of time

BT: while we’re talking about 64 bit, we might want to talk about 64 bit arrays in wasmgc. Maybev it doesn’t fit into this proposal but it’s a similar thing, it might matter for the future.

SC: WasmGC is using 32-bit indices for arrays?

BT: That's right.

CW: my suggestion for going forward would be to make an issue on Github that people can thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and we can use that to assess consensus and drive a future poll.

SC to post such an issue.

###	2. Discuss custom Wasm page sizes: https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1512 (Nick Fitzgerald, 30 minutes)
Slides: Custom Wasm Page Sizes

NP [chat]: Thank you, great proposal and summary! We had to define custom memory page sizes adhoc to get multiple modules to fit on embedded devices, with the downsides mentioned. It seems reasonable to address these needs here


CW: question: I'm surprised that they implement small memories in a way that causes divergence: couldn’t they just refuse to compile a module that asks for too much memory?

NF: There are a bunch of ways to do this that preserve semantics, but they let you observe the difference by just probing memory.

CW: oh, the problem is that their constraint is that there’s less than 1 page of memory available?

NF: yes. The problem is that this engine is shipping on millions of devices with this non-standard extension. So we need to address this in a standards-based way [back to presentation]

CW: Phase 1 vote would be fine. We explicitly do not require advance notice of phase 1 polls.

OS: one of the concerns i might have: you mentioned the Faas use case. If we dont’ allow the engine to decide the page size for FaaS, we might have portability concerns. If I’m a FaaS provider I want people to just ship their modules to me and and I can just run them, but i want modules that don't need much memory to not use much. But i have to rely on the users to do work to use less memory and they might not be incentivized to do that.
(I care more about embedded, but this seems like a concern for FaaS though)

NF: We won't introduce larger page sizes than we have today, so if you're a FaaS service that can run Wasm today, that will remain true in the future.

OS: true. But I don’t imagine toolchains by default today will say that they want to use a smaller page size. But if all the modules in a shared system use a smaller page size, then i can fit a lot more instances in, but the coordination might not happen.

CW: I like the proposal but would be concerned about allowing arbitrary non-power-of-2 sizes. I like allowing only 1 and 64k most at the moment.

NF: I think 1 and 64k would be fine. Or if we want it t6o be a multiple of ourlargest memory access size, then 16 and 64 would work well too. It might be a little weird that it’ snot 1, but 2 values could serve the use case.


AR: we have this unfortunate use of a sentinel value in memory size that we interpret as failure (-1), we could possibly run into that with page size 1. Sentinel values turn out to be bad idea.

NF?:

AR: That was my other question, what does this imply for max sizes? Would we still allow up to 4G or specify in terms of number of pages?

TL (chat): make the min size 2.

AC (chat): 16 bytes is the maximum size to load today, but that may not always be the case with proposals like flexible-vectors.

NF: I was thinking that this wouldn't have any effect on limits, but I suppose we could change the max memory size to 2^32-2 for the case of 1-byte pages to avoid the sentinel problem.

PP: I agree in principle that this is a good idea and we can figure out the sizes offline.

CW: agree that we don’t need to concretely solve that today, but we do still have time to discuss here.

BT: I think we should support powers of 2 up to 64k because the spec process takes a long time and we might as well just spec taht. I think wasm is capable of adapting to the hardware, and since we’re crossing into having more than one page size, we might as well just have all of them.
Also for gc maybe we could pin parts of GC arrays as memories, in which case it could make sense to have 1 byte pages. So maybe going all the way down to 1 makes sense.

CW: I would potentially think the opposite. Any feature that maps structures into memory seems scarier if the memory is not a multiple of the OS page size because then they can't use OS APIs.

NF: I would share that concern. Generally any kind of overlap with future virtual memory-y proposals could restrict themselves to memories that have certain page sizes. But that’s also a question for those proposals, what to do with systems that don’t have virtual memories.

CW: This is why I'm drawn to having just 1 and 64k. It's very clear that the 1-byte page is slow but you have full control and the 64k page will be fast, but you have less control.

PP: Nick mentioned that engines already do this? What kind of page sizes do they use? 

NF: Don't know exactly what multiple they're using. They're looking at __data_end and __heap_base and other globals, then assuming the Wasm won't access (much) past those.

PP: if someone already has devices that r un this, they have some idea of what they can support. The embedded world typically likes to support arbitrary numbers, maybe not want just powers of 2

NF: if we support 1, then people can just use anything they want. And I suspect if we use 16, then that could still be good enough.

CW: I would be less excited about picking 16 because it’s the largest access we have today, we could have larger in the future.
My concrete concern with totally arbitrary numbers is just that it increases the fuzzing surface.

ChrisW (chat): Nick, thank you. Great proposal!

If we don’t have more comments, we could run the poll?

Phase 1 poll: custom page sizes 

SF: 22
F: 15
N: 0
A: 0
SA: 0


Poll passes, custom page sizes to phase 1.
