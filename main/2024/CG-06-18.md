### Proposals and discussions

#### Transactions and Persistence (Eliot Moss, 45 minutes)
TODO: slides link

Status slide: comments?

CW: Do you think of this feature as exposing HW transactional memory to Wasm, or does it have to be implemented in software? Also, are the casts implemented by having a lock in the runtime for each location? What does that look like if implemented in core Wasm rather than in a language extension?

EM: about HTM: one design goal is to allow most transactions to at least attempt to carry out with hardwareTM. Implementations have limitations about how big transactions can be, so any system has to have a SW fallback.

Second question: the idea is that each granule has a memory location associated with it, that would have a version number and/or packed into one word, and a current transaction owner which you could use to implement “optimistic reads” and “pessimistic write” so if you are writing you take a lock but if you read you check the version number and see if it’s changed when you finished. You don’t have to do it that way but it’s a typical implementation. I modeled it that way in the reference interpreter.


CW: Is the concept that if we tried to do this with regular Wasm instructions, it would be much slower?

EM: maybe. It would be a lot more complicated. Because you’d have to build up all this underlying structure yourself. Build up a data structure of all the things you’re locking, you might be able to do it more efficiently in a runtime system than using wasm types for it. You could link directly through things rather than having to allocate object to build a list.

CW: that story makes sense… I'm just thinking how we would evaluate it if we were thinking of putting it in the language

AR: You said we could use exceptions for signaling conflicts, but how do the conflicts become observable in the semantics in the first place?

EM: you would typically detect conflict either when you try to acquire an item in a transaction for read/write and another transaction has e.g. locked it for writing, then one of the transactions loses.

AR: What happens in that case?

EM: In the reference interpreter, the longer running transaction wins based on timestamps. The other has to be rolled back. 
So far so good. But not only is that unwinding happening, you can also think of there being an exception thrown to indicate that this one failed.

AR: What does unwind mean? What happens after you have unwound the failed transaction? Do you get a trap, or an error code?

EM: if you have no handler, then I guess it’s what wasm would call a trap, but if you have a handler of some kind then you go down an alternate execution path.

AR: We normally use traps only for real fatal failures. Doesn't seem to be the right thing here.

EM: if no handler with retry was provided. So I think the way you’d typically translate a higher level language, you would have a handler that says if it aborts we’ll retry it up to k times and if you fail that many times, then you give up.

AR: The point is the retry has to be programmed in user code, it's not automatic?

EM: right. That seemed to me a better design than building some fixed retry mechanism into the system. 
You could do that, it’s the kind of thing we could discuss. You could also say we’ll have the lower level system retry some number of times, perhaps controllable by parameter.

AR: I think that makes sense given the low-level nature of the language. Another comment you said is that there are no proposals you could find that would interfere. How would it interact with stack switching?

EM: if you view switching from one continuation to antler as effectively switching execution contexts, then if you’re in the middle of a transaction, it’s just not p;rogressing but you wouldn’t bring it with you. You wouldn't bring that transaction context with you to the new context.

AR: But the continuation you switch to, wouldn't it have to be on the same side of the transactional/non-transactional fence?

EM: I guess it depends on whether you want the continuations to be in the same or different transactions. I haven't thought about how you would express that.

AR: or maybe another answer could be that the transaction could not run across a stack switch.

EM: That's the simplest way to do things. I guess we're assuming there's no thread parallelism within a transaction. Continuations within a transaction would be an intermediate thing. Then you have to start wondering if we need nested transactions in case the continuations conflict.

BT: about nested vs flat transactions: if you try to open a nested transaction, does that succeed?

EM: Like one tfunc calling another tfunc? It just flattens the nesting rather than creating a new transaction scope.

AR: just slightly more detail about the type system. The transactionality attribute on all the things is sort of a generalization of the shared-everything proposal.

EM: I'm not aware of that.

AR: Same idea, you can add shared to everything, not just memories. In our case, the attribute is not on the reference but on the referenced type. So you would have a transactional struct type, then every reference to it would be transactional. Is it useful to have a non-transactional reference to a transactional thing?

EM: I suppose it could be, you're just passing the identity of something around ,and then some other part of the code might want to access it transactionally. I added the access permissions to the reference types. So a tref none… i don’t know if those could be brought into a single type conveniently or not. But underneath yeah they're just a pointer to something in a heap.

AR: Thanks.

EM returns to slides on persistence

PP: with shared vs transactional, if you add persistence, it's another dimension. It almost sounds like it needs to be an attribute, so we can remove the distinction instead of having separate types, we almost need parameters to the types. It could be simpler, but the intersection could get large.

EM: There could be issues with not every subset of the attributes making sense together. This shows up in the encoding.

PP: some of the things, runtimes would have an an encoding, and de-facto have something like that ‘kind’ byte

TL: I'm wondering about users. Are there languages, libraries or toolchains that would be eager to adopt this?

EM: short answer is, not yet, we’re hoping that if we start this, they will come. It’s a bit of a chicken and egg thing. If there’s not good infrastructure, it’s a huge amount of work to make a transactional/persistent version of a system or language. This grew out of an NSF project with the goal to provide an infrastructure to make it easy for languages to get a well-engineered transactional version.

AR: Usually doing something on module boundaries is the wrong idea because they're just grouping mechanisms.

EM: I would apply that to the heaps for sure. Objects can point to any other object in the heap and it doesn’t matter which module they came from, but every module has its own global variables. That’s really the only sense i meant

AR: The thing is you can import and export between modules, so there are not clear boundaries. With references you don't see that.

EM: oh no you wouldn't. I’m saying there's a single persistent heap, but each module could declare a memory, and those are distinct.

CW: So each instance does not have its own heap, they all use a single heap off to the side?

EM: what i was calling a store would have a persistent heap and a collection of persistent linear memories, tables, etc. I think they would have names that would maybe match up with module export names.

AR: In the store, you're right you have a sequence of memories, but they can be arbitrarily shared. So there is nothing that naturally ties them to module boundaries.

EM: maybe thinking of them as boundaries isn’t the right word, but some module declares a memory and you have to have the idea that memory is in a certain store.

CW: i think it’s ok, we could have written point 5 as “there is a single persistent store where these memories live”

EM: When I wrote "instance" I meant what the spec calls a "store"

AR: yeah that is actually what the spec also calls a “store”. you don't even have a way to observe different stores.

BT: are there runtime optimizations that you're envisioning, beyond just using the available HTM? e.g. are there things the engine would be expected to do, e.g. combining transactions?

EM: Not a lot. For my PhD students to dig in I hope. Combining a number of short transactions is a possibility. Maybe optimizing very short transactions. Mostly paring down all the checks and data copying work to get inherent overheads as low as possible.

CWoods: partly an answer to “is there anyone interested with use cases”: Maybe? We might have something we can discuss offline.

PP: High assurance systems would be interested in this with persistence.

CW: one interesting way to really get this moving and attract people to use it, might be to investigate a version of wasm with these extensions vs one that has the features implemented on top, and see if people can target the userspace version to bootstrap.

EM: If you want to access multiple data items and do so atomically, even if you're not concerned about rollback, then it's really hard to design a system that avoids deadlock. It's easy to grab the locks out of order. Imagine moving items in a data structure, locking the items in the wrong order could lead to deadlock.

CW: are you saying it would be feasible for a runtime to work out how to do this, but not a static elaboration to webassembly?

EM: it’s hard to e.g. make guarantees about locks, acquiring them in the right order

CW: If you start with all the Wasm modules that have these types, could you come up with a total order between all the locks ahead of time?

EM: no, because you can create new objects on the fly. You can come up with an ordering but you can’t guarantee to acquire the locks in that order.

CW: You might need something like a generation number on the object.

EM: that’s not the problem, the object are put in particular places, how do you make your code grab them in a particular order.

CW: Is this a problem of the user-written code or a problem of the engine trying to implement transactions?

EM it’s a problem of the user code, there's the possibility of conflict and deadlock, a general transaction mechanism will detect it and undo the transaction

CW: My suggestion was to imagine a wasm-to-wasm compilation pass that lowers the new primitives to core Wasm.

EM: you might be able to write a transactional runtime in wasm, if that’s what you're saying. Like writing a garbage collector in userspace.

CW: Sure, I'm suggesting this as a method to get it in front of people easily. The standards process would take a long time.

EM: It's right there in the OCaml reference implementation already. So that's one of the questions for next steps. Should i do some sort of pull request or what

CW: For the standards process, we would eventually have to get Web engines to implement it, and this would be an easy way for folks to try it out.

NF: do we have any reason to believe that this lock ordering is more likely to be implemented correctly or more easily in the engine, rather than a wasm producer?

EM: that it’s easier to build a transactional runtime rather than a user trying to build it on top?

NF: the choice is the engine runtime engineers vs the producer engineers, i.e. the toolchain.

EM: I think that's similar to what Conrad was saying. Could we build all this mechanism in pure Wasm? Yes because it's Turing complete, but it might not be good.

CW: theres a slight difference between what i’m suggesting is you could imagine a conversion from your instructions to pure wasm.

Or you could convince the producers to do all that themselves.

NF: It makes sense that if there's hardware support for transactions, then the host would have to provide that. But for the parts that aren't hardware-backed, would it make more sense to allow folks to build on top of core Wasm without extension?

If it’s the same amount of work to do the software inside the engine or inside wasm, then it makes sense to do it in inside wasm

EM: you’re throwing the burden back on the user community, as opposed to the implementer community. My theory about that (with GC it certainly holds) you’re going to get more correct more performant implementations from experts who really know how to do it i you build it inside the engine. And you also save the user communities from doing it over and over in each user program. That's opinion, but you save the user communities from having to do it over and over again. But I'm not involved in the business community side of things.

FM: there’s been some discussion about a macro extension capability. If you had something liek that you could use it to prototype TM also about GC: even with wasmGC there are languages that can’t use wasmGC for their garbage collection so it’s not just about expertise. Definitely the ergonomic question, e.g. go, Prolog and scheme can’t use it. Beyond your presentation but might be worth revitalizing it. 

PP [chat]:
Another concern for user-implemented transactions is size of such a runtime, how much extra binary producer would have to ship

BT [chat]:
My point was going to be: sometimes exposing the details of the abstraction allows malicious / broken code to break the abstraction, so just a locking discipline can be violated, leading to deadlock. Deadlock is a global property that cannot be effectively policed at the implementation level.
