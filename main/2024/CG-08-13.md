### Proposals and discussions

#### Update on the ESM integration

GB presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Po0FlImrq1DJUARuZRssDshVtQGwz-YlnsdVrkA2UvE/)

FM: Can you explain why you don't need wasm-unsafe-eval anymore?

GB: We're treating Wasm and JS as equal capability formats. Wasm is determined by MIME type and can import and execute arbitrary JS. The script-src model says which URLs are allowed to be executed and covers both Wasm and JS. It can relate Wasm modules to their original URLs. It allows you to ban running arbitrary bytes, so it's stronger.

FM: IIUC, even though you're not compiling Wasm as part of the import, even though the bytes come from a known source, it's ok.

GB: Right. We can use those stronger CSP checks with a trust link to the URL.

TL: What's the story for importing string constants now that the import module is configurable?

RH: Probably have two choices: we could pick a default name, or we could make it something we specify with import attributes or similar. I can help figure that out for ESM integration.

GB: Yes, let's follow up on that.

JK (chat): How would you pass imports to that Wasm instantiation?

GB: The imports come from whatever is in the host module registry. Maybe the dynamic imports are not so useful. It needs to be discussed. We may get additional machinery and new features using import attributes.

AZ (chat): Is there an example of how   new Worker("./worker.wasm", { type: module })  would be used? I can't seem to find an example on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports or https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration so maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?

GB (chat): The proposal is here: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-esm-phase-imports

#### New stage 1 proposal: [128-bit arithmetic](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1522)

AC presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1szj9D2q43NrQhxtys2OBAAMjeAOanCNMIS4D0gPaYuI/)

NF (chat): 128bit load/store atomicity might be a portability problem as well. Also tearing on page boundaries. And if half traps will the other half of a store happen or not.

BT: Did comparison come up in discussion of use cases?

AC: No, it hasn't come up yet.

NF (chat): Just a comment: I like that you two have been focusing on use case-driven solutions

PP: Do you expect this to work in browsers? What are the use cases?

AC: Same use cases. e.g. crypto.

PP: Do you need in-wasm crypto on the Web?

AC: Maybe not cryptography, but there are other use cases.

NF (chat): Big num libraries

DG: If you're looking for a browser signal, we are excited about closing this performance gap.

PP: Sounds good, but skeptical about the crypto use case in particular. Different engines might have different performance characteristics…

AC: We wanted to use an initial performance signal to guide the proposal, but we can do more experimentation in later proposals.

KM: I'm surprised it's so hard to optimize the carry flags. Maybe it's hard to know that the value is only 0 or 1? Maybe we could have a flag type that's related to i32 or something like that. It's more expensive to recompute a flag than to push it into a register.

JS: Two issues: flags are magic and cannot be register allocated. It makes instruction selection more difficult. It needs some peephole opts.

KM: Is that hard?

JS: It is for us. We didn't see how to implement it in Cranelift.

AC: LLVM made this easy, but not Cranelift. I would be interested in looking at this more. We don't have an adequate benchmark for the use case of detecting overflows, where you only want the flag.

KM: From a high-level design, it seems a shame not to add the simpler operations that we might add in the future anyway.

JS: The question of what design is simpler is an interesting one. Some use cases are more natural to express with overflow-with-carry or 128-bit ops.

JK (chat): +1, definitely interested in particular in some way to do efficient i64*i64=i128 multiplications. (No strong opinion on the exact details.)

DL (chat): 
People do implement crypto in Wasm for in-browser usage, e.g., the web client of WhatsApp uses libsodium through libsignal AFAIK.

PP (chat):  Oh, interesting, do you have any more insights into what would be needed there? There were two suggestions for related things, but they haven’t reached a proposal stage. https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1433 and https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1388.

DL (chat): I don't have much insight here, just opened web.whatsapp.com ~12 months ago, and found a Wasm module with some indicative strings and functions in there (curve25519_{sign, verify, init}, sha512,  crypto_sign_ed25519_ref10_ge_scalarmult_base), which lead me to https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-c/blob/master/src/curve25519/ed25519/ge.h. There's also quite some reverse dependencies of https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium.

BH (chat): Adobe gave a wasmday presentation on the need to have crypto "in the box" for the edge content authenticity service. I think this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48ORmla7mak. But they've given two. Could be this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_iCimJrLzM.

CW: I would like to avoid adding a new flag type or something like that.

FM: Have you considered bit rolling operations like rotations, etc?

AC: No, we haven't looked at those. Those would need the 128-bit ops.

AC: The proposal name is "128-bit arithmetic", but I think overflow ops should explicitly be in scope.

Phase 1 proposal

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 9  |11 |4 | 0 | 0 |

TL: We have consensus.

KM: I'm in favor of exploring the area, but I think the flags issue may be more important in later stages.
