### Proposals and discussions

#### Advance proposals to Phase 5


RH: Presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lVfHLKI8luCjf__kYEaLzlBT3wzk6RdMH19onMORSs0/edit?slide=id.g3711186297e_0_37#slide=id.g3711186297e_0_37)

RH: These are just in chronological order.
For threads, it’s not 100% clear whether the tests and document are all totally finished. We might want to wait for confirmation from conrad.

RH: I recently tried to run them and it didn’t quite work.

Discussion: consensus was that we can wait until we get more confirmation. We’ll postpone the vote on this.

RH: Exceptions: As far as I know, no outstanding issues. I think it’s ready to go, we run all the tests, and it seems good.

Poll:
SF: 5
(no other votes)

Exceptions advances to phase 5.

JS string builtins:

RH: This is shipped in 2 browsers, tests in WPT, spec is up to date, PR open to merge into 3.0, not aware of any issues.

Poll:
SF: 5

JS string builtins advances to phase 5.

Memory 64: This advanced to phase 4 in november, shipped in Chrome and FF. spec is complete and tests have been imported from spec into FF.

Poll:
SF: 5

Memory64 advances to phase 5.

JSPI: this went to phase 4 in April

RH: It’s shipped in Chrome, but behind a pref in firefox still, not quite ready to release. We have plans to productionize this year, but haven’t yet. So, a question is, does it need to ship in 2 browsers? Only implementation is required for phase 4, and we have no formal requirement for anything more to go to phase 5, but shipping would be nice.

LW: how do you feel about it?

RH: I’d be more comfortable if it was shipped, even though I don’t anticipate any changes. Mostly what we need to do are security hardening, audits, etc. But it’s a bit of a long tail. Would be nice from a procedural standpoint.
Is Francis really impatient?

TL: The only downside I can think of is whether it misses 3.0 entirely?

RH: I’m happy to bring this back up later this year after we ship it. We’ll have to do that with threads anyway.


A Side question is what we want to do with the document: 

DS: we are a rec-trac document, currently in CR. We are auto-publishing each commit as a CR draft. It probably makes sense to try to publish a snapshot periodically, perhaps each year.  if we want to do that, I think we need another horizontal review. At some point we might want to integrate horizontal review into the CG process before phase 4 so any feedback would be early enough to be more helpful.

RH: Did we get any feedback from the horizontal review?

DS: No, other than the wat unicode identifier thing, which we already had a fix for in 3.0.  but there’s not much actually on 2.0 which is what is included in our current snapshot.

TL: The 3.0 branch has just been a working space for merges. The real plan is to get the spectec repo to be the real thing, which is supposed to happen soon. But that keeps getting delayed, there has been some external confusion because people are referring to the current 2.0 spec and don’t know where to find the official spec for things beyond that.

RH: If we wanted to integrate more review into the CG process but want to avoid getting feedback on every little thing, we could come up with some criteria, e.g. if it involves the JS API, if it adds nondeterminism, etc.
