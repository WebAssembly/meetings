### Proposals and discussions

TL: Reminder that Fastly is hosting a CG meeting in San Francisco on February 12-13, with research day on Feb 11. Register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei-6h9luzk71GDHYi6avRftA5SyQOgL31mJIBu1BJ2Vhh0og/viewform) if you plan to attend in person. Details at https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/main/2025/CG-02.md.

#### WASI Subgroup co-chair: vote to elect Yosh Wuyts (@yoshuawuyts), Pat Hickey (@pchickey) to step down

PH: I have been a co-chair with Bailey for a long time and am ready to pass the torch. Yosh has been involved and super active for the past couple of years, including a lot of work on 0.2 and 0.3 release

BH: Thank you, Pat! Yosh has been doing a huge amount of work

TL: let’s go ahead and vote. Should we do a unanimous consensus poll?

PH: we did that for the last chair transition, it should be good.

TL: Sounds good, any objections to Yosh as WASI co-chair?
<none>
Sounds good, thanks

YW: Thanks for your confidence, I look forward to working with you all.

#### Rounding Variants Proposal (refresher IA, status report, discussions, vote phase II) [30min]

KK: presenting [slides](presentations/2025-01-28-kloudkoder-rounding-mode.pdf)

CW: Is there a slide for the instructions?

KK: there is an instruction set in github, I don’t have a list in the presentation

PD: I didnt prepare slides, we can look now.

Sharing https://github.com/WebAssembly/rounding-mode-control/blob/main/proposals/rounding-mode-control/Overview.md.

DD: If you’re on a chip that is not AVX10/512 the currently intended lowering is to modify the RM system register, and toggle that between instructions?

PD: Yes, currently we do a prolog/epilog for each instruction where you flip the mode. In theory you could optimize in the engine where you cancel out redundant mode changes.

DD: That sounds reasonable. In the bad case where you have to keep changing, is that really expensive? Do you have numbers for your use cases of how much time you spend doing that?

PD: There is some penalty. The question is what you're comparing against.
Currently purely in software, it’s 600k wasm instructions to emulate all the operations in the proposal, and it’s an order of magnitude faster to do it with hardware, [even with the mode switches.?]

DD: I guess I'm thinking of the scenario where we advance the proposal before the hardware is widely available. Is it even so much better with the default support available now?

PD: Changing the rounding mode is ~20 micro instructions, then you might have some pipeline flush.

CW: It sounds like you’re saying that even if we do the most naive thing, it’s still a big performance improvement.

PD: it’s a huge improvement, thousands of wasm instructions in emulation vs just a few if you use the hardware, the mode switch plus the arithmetic instruction

CW: Would be helpful to have a bar graph of the runtimes on that microbenchmark.

PD: The scale will have to be logarithmic.

CW: That will be even more impressive.

PD: I’ll do a diagram and post it in the repo.

CW: if the diagram isn’t good, even just posting the number showing the speed would be helpful, compared to just listing numbers of instructions.

TL: Is there more to the presentation?

PD: presenting [slides](presentations/2025-01-28-pauldennis-rounding-mode.pdf)

(showing example of test cases and some SSE2-based implementation in V8)

TL: To clarify, the goal is phase 2 poll today?

DD: This is an artifact of the encoding: every combination of RM and  operation is its own opcode now? Have you thought of having the RM as a separate byte? It would make it a little bigger but reduce use of the opcodes. And make it easier to add more.

PD: I don't believe we will get other rounding modes in the future. The only other that would be interesting to do in hardware is round-to-nearest even/odd, but I don't think that will happen soon. Also the set of opcodes will be fairly stable as well. We won't need to add more at this layer.

DD: I'm picturing where someone comes with another proposal or wants, say, banker’s rounding and we have to add more abstractions. Unless the binary size is really critical, I think it would be simpler.
I think it makes the proposal an easier pill to swallow when there are fewer instructions.

PP: The flexible vectors proposal has something similar to what DD described, you don’t need a new opcode for every operation, you can have a prefix for each RM that goes with each operation. Shrinks use of opcodes a lot.

PD: In terms of implementing in V8 and the reference interpreter, using a simple opcode is simpler because the infrastructure is already there.
There’s plenty of opcode space, right?


CW: Depends on how long you want your instructions to be.

TL: We don’t need to solve this today, but shouldn’t wait too long.

BT: Do the RMs also apply to SIMD instructions, or will they in the future?

PD: In terms of IA, it would be enough to just have 64-bit (or just 32 bit). You are concerned about the error bounds. The instructions all look similar, but the use cases are quite different. For interval arithmetic, this proposal is enough. I wouldn't need SIMD versions personally.

AC: Do you have an example of what it looks like to use this from a source language? Existing intrinsics, or something else. Do you need to port the libraries or use a flag, or what?

PD: I was imagining compiler intrinsics. The libraries need a little porting. They have lots of different backends for different hardware or optimizations. So maybe they need 20 lines of code or whatever to do the equivalent in wasm.

TL: I think we can go to the poll. The entry requirements for phase 2 are : https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/phases.md#2-feature-description-available-community--working-group so the only thing left here is “reasonably high level of consensus”. During phase 2 we prototype, so we are a little ahead of that.

Let’s do a 5-way poll.

SF: 6
F: 18
N: 10
A: 0
SA: 0

TL: Looks like clear consensus, the proposal advances to phase 2, thanks!
