### Proposals and discussions

#### [Additional JS primitive builtins](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1558) (Sébastien Doeraene, 25 minutes)

SD Presenting (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EjR1zLBKQ_AWS9_bx4FgIKXdR2o1p9u1A-XE28AUhhI/edit?usp=sharing)

FM: There's a recent addition to JS: The temporal library. It's very large. The toUpperCase and toLowerCase argument applies to that, and even more so.

SD: Good point. Someone from wasm-of-ocaml also posted in the design thread that they wanted access to WeakMap. It's probably a worthwhile discussion, but I tried to limit this specific proposal to JS primitives. Weakmap and temporal are not primitives, so that’s the boundary I’ve drawn here.

BV: On that note, in principle I think you could say that any large JS API might be better as a builtin. But you can always import things and I would be surprised if for e.g. temporal, the call is really dominating your cost there, I think it makes more sense to focus on the primitives for now.

JK (chat): +1 to Ben: builtins really only make sense for tiny operations, where call overhead is large in relation to the cost of the operation.

GB: I was curious about trapping behavior. Makes sense for type checks, but e.g. for range errors, did you consider exceptions?

SD: This is taken from the precedent of string builtins. They trap on out of bounds or if given something that is not a string. Since you have type tests and other operations, you can test ahead of time and throw an exception from WebAssembly code.

TT: To clarify, what I saw was that you're using basic Wasm expressiveness, but doing boxing and unboxing right costs performance?

SD: Yes, you can be smarter about it, e.g. on the i31ref thing. You can avoid a lot of the cost for i32s by adding codepaths with i31ref if the int happens to fit into 31 bits. That’s often but still doesn’t fix the problem for other types.

TT: To get rid of this boxing and unboxing, you want to harmonize the different type representations?

SD: You’re not really getting rid of it. In practice if you ask JS to take a f64, it will allocate it on the heap unless there’s nanboxing or whatever. But you get whatever JS understands  without the overhead of calling across the JS/wasm boundary which is expensive compared to the primitive operations.

TT: I don't know if this fits, but you try to mitigate the performance hit of having the ABIs, and with this builtin you bind it to a JS runtime. You can't run outside a JS embedder.

SD: Yes, this whole thing is really for a JS embedder. The problem that we have in the first place is a problem of JS interop. 

TT: With this approach, it's the binding that you give into it, and then you're allowed to share the same data with the host runtime. That's what you meant by sharing the tables?

SD: the tables are really for e.g. if you want to do efficient parsing and conversion between f64 and strings, that has big hard-coded tables of magic numbers. toUpperCase and toLowerCase have big tables.

TT: You would get the same problem outside of JS runtimes if the embedder is a different language. How do you position this proposal in that regard?

SD: if you have a component model available in your host, presumably your host would provide a component that would convert between strings and floats then you could get access that way. For JS/web, there’s no real plan to build the CM into there as far as I know.

NF (chat): compile-time builtins are a question of the embedding API, not the component model

LW: jco transpile polyfills the CM using JS glue code. For some of those primitives the JS code could instead be wasm code. So this could be useful for that, and complementary.

CW: Is there a similarity in the goals with the CM? CM is also for language interoperability. Is there space for collaboration and sharing techniques? Is it worth having a subgroup for compatibility rather than committing to a particular technical path?

SD: possibly. Maybe someone who is deeper into the CM has something more intelligent to say about that.

NF(chat): because compile-time builtins are specifically about providing host functionality, not something that (modulo virtualization) is provided by another component

TL: that’s the key difference between this and the CM. 

NF: the compile time builtins aren't providing new expressibility, they could be compiled to wasm. If you have compile-time builtins you sort of want them at the embedder API level similarly to how strings are at the JS API level. Each runtime has its own embedding API and that’s where you want them to provide optimization, rather than semantics or expressivity.

TL: in a future where we have CM support on the web, or jco, you could have a string component that on the web is just a thin wrapper around string builtins, and off the web you’d have a polyfill in wasm as a component, and you can just switch them. So it does seem complementary.

TT(chat): I see the point. Was just wondering about the goal to "harmonize" differences in type representation (with having a low impact on performance) and its commonalities with the CM.

NF(chat): agreed, with TL’s point.

SD: should we have a vote?

TL: since this is phase 1, and we haven’t heard anyone speak against this, we can do unanimous consent.  We can continue the essentials vs nice-to-haves offline.
Any objections to moving this to phase 1?

[none].

Proposal moves to phase 1, thanks! See you in 2 weeks.
