### Proposals and discussions

####  1. Final request for [scheduling constraints](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/1781) for the next in-person meeting (Thomas Lively, brief)

Based on room availability, the CG meeting later this year in Munich will likely be held in the last week of October. Some folks have commitments at the end of the week so we’ll have the CG meeting on Tuesday-Wednesday (28-29 October) and the research day on Thursday (30th). If you’d strongly prefer the first week of November, it might be possible but there won’t be as much room. Let us know very soon; otherwise we’ll plan on the last week of October.

#### Update on the custom-page-sizes proposal and vote for phase 3 (Nick Fitzgerald, 20 minutes)

NF presenting slides: [custom-page-sizes phase 3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Aqj_mnCmaOhmNzQrKqDr3I5LUm7MkUgfoel1O5WIjs4/edit?usp=sharing)

CW: Was there any feedback from the Wamr team on this?

NF: They have an issue open to track implementing the feature, but no other feedback.

CW: ok, it wasn’t on the list of implementations, so I just wanted to check on that.

Poll: Advance the custom-page-sizes proposal to phase 3

Proposal advances to phase 3

#### Temperature check on JS builtin interop & the ESM Integration (Guy Bedford, 25 minutes)

GB Presenting (TODO: link)

TL: on the object builtins example. Does node/deno not know about these bulletins, where do they come from?

GB: I wrote it into these local JS files and node will load them.


Slide: Direct Global Export

TL: can you give an example of live bindings support?

GB: in this example, we have a mutable global export on the interface object that we mutate in the start function. If you had another function that changed this object global, it would reflect it to all JS importers. So live bindings from wasm out to JS but not from JS inward to wasm

TL: so currently this doesn’t work; instead the object gets snapshotted at import time?

GB it does, because you get the global wrapper. And when you call value on it, you get the current value.  It’s because of how the JS API aspect of Webassembly.global. So we’d be unwrapping that 

TL: do these go as a pair? Would we want to unwrap the globals without supporting live bindings?

GB we could still allow unwrapping at binding time, snapshot all globals, mutable or not, without live bindings. I would like to hear feedback about that. I don't see why live bindings couldn’t work but it's a bit of an implementation question. 

AR: Similar question: if you implicitly unwrap, would you still have a handle on the global? Is this an optional feature? you might use the global to instantiate another module; would that still work?

GB: yes, we keep the wasm instance around, so we still have the global wrapper in the background, and when a wasm module imports this module, it doesn’t go through the JS wrappe,r it goes directly to the underlying wasm. So you have 2 representations; one to JS and the other for wasm. If you look at PR 104 the main part is keeping the instance around so we still have the global bindings.

AR: syntactically in the import, how can i distinguish between the wrapped and unwrapped for, and choose between them?

GB: in the JS API, this is only in the instance phase embedding of ESM integration. The JS API itself would still use the wasm global wrapping on the imports object. This is only for the ESM integration; if you’re using source phase it would work like before.

AR: Assuming I import something using ESM and then I have some other part of my app that does dynamic instantiation. Can these cooperate nicely?

GB: to get nice cooperation, we’d need an additional condition in the JS API import object that would detect one of these namespaces, and then use the spec unwrapping to get the underlying global that way.

AR: it sounds like a lot of magic and implicit coercions to me. But I'm not the target audience.

GB: that’s why we’re here to get feedback.

CW: one question not strictly about the technical material. You floated before, what would this look like to get to phase 4. We were hoping for web implementations. Have you thought more about what you’d want for that, given that this will likely be transpiled for quite a while?

GB: yes, and there’s also a question about when browsers are shipping the source phase but node and deno are shipping the implementation phase. Can we call that phase 4 too. If we’re in a position where node and deno are shipping instance phase but not browsers, and we need a follow-up discussion about phase 4, maybe that’s the time? It depends on how things go here from an implementation perspective.

CW: what’s the JS committee’s perspective on this? On the phase progression.

GB: source phase would require 2 browsers implementation. We’d be able to go to stage 4 later this year or early next year, we could do it together with wasm or not. The TC39 proposal is only for source phases, the instance phase has no TC39 part.

Interest/ temperature- check poll: New compile-time builtin imports should be specified to support a minimal set of JS interop builtins, including (TODO fill in from the slide)

RH: question on jco.  (note taker missed this)

GB: it would be overall a binary size improvement not to have 1000 lines of JS. it’s also a path to push forward what a JS embedding would need for supporting a whole component embedding. Feature-wise it’s just the performance benefit.

TL: I'm not sure it would be a performance benefit. All the machinery for optimizing JS wouldn’t be there in the wasm context. It might be slower.

GB: this is where an experimental jco output could be interesting to verify some of these questions. Unfortunately I won't have the time to do that experiment soon. I think there are 2 types of code: the wiring code to get things off the global and connect them. Probably not the performance-sensitive part. The performance case is probably after the wiring is done, on the hot paths. The wiring part is probably more about saving code size. And ergonomics. I’m not really trying to sell this model, just want to gauge interest.

SYG: question about experience with JS string builtins. Strings as primitives: if you just import from JS you don’t need to add much to make it useful. But for objects and functions, it seems you need a lot of glue to interface with your wasm unless your wasm is designed to directly consume JS things. There’s a difference between strings,which are very simple, and more general objects, web APIs, etc. I imagine Wasm users aren’t directly coding against web APIs so you have to adapt. How much is just shuffling glue code from JS into Wasm?

GB: That’s a good point; one of the key considerations is how much do you want this JS-flavored wasm. The ESM is. The instance phase does require shoehorning into the JS conventions, so we have source phase to not require that model. This is a rephrase as “an” embedding rather than “the” embedding. So maybe it’s not as extreme as pushing the whole ecosystem into that model.
The source phase is still sort of the recommended model, and this is more experimental.

SYG: do we have experience from e.g. deno where we’ve seen people directly coding against web apis?

DSherret: you already have to do this with things like wasm bindgen, you have rust and you create an adapter. If there was something more builtin that everyone could standardize around, it would be helpful.

RH: if we had JS object builtins and JS function builtins, they wouldn’t start with any of the optimizations that JS functions have. We could add some over time, there’s some question about what the runtime behavior of glue code vs other code would be. Maybe a small amount of optimization on getters would be good, but overall you could imagine having that over the long term, but there are some open questions there, it’s an interesting research problem but not totally obvious that it makes sense. So in terms of temperature, I’d maybe say “warm”. 

JK (chat): your example showed a handful of lines of JS that are required to polyfill this. Where do 1000s of lines of savings come from?

TL (chat): From using that handful of lines of JS to move 1000s of other lines of JS into Wasm.

JK (chat): Sounds like you could move from 1000s of lines of JS to a handful of lines of JS without needing any new compile-time builtins then?

TL (chat): Yes, true. Not sure these need to be builtins.

Interest poll:

- F: 5
- N: 20
- A: 1

JK (chat): (not strongly opposed, but not convinced it solves enough of a problem to be worth having)


CW: i’d also say, slightly suspicious neutral. JS objects and Functions seem one of the scarier things to build integrations for, it seems easier to start with data.

AR: similar comment. Features like this would be conservative extensions we could add later. It may makes sense to ship a minimal version  and then experiment later

SYG (chat): I don't think they're scary per se, but seems like assumes a day 1 architectural decision from the app to make use of them

Interest poll 2: Wasm ESM instances should support direct global bindings on their ESM objects.

- F: 6
- N: 15
- A: 1

AR (chat): I'm wary of implicit conversions

###Discussion of (https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-string-builtins/issues/47) with action item to register a `wasm:` scheme with IANA (Ryan Hunt, 15 min)

RH presenting (TODO: link)

Solutions: switching away from wasm : is a little gross, kind of goes against the spirit of using URLs
I think the second option makes the most sense. It would be something the CG would need to approve.
 
FM: I thought URLs didn’t refer to the type of the source being referenced, but more about how to access it (rather than what’s inside). So the wasm:.// schemes doesn’t make sense? Think e.g. http vs ftp vs file; it's’ about how to get the resource

RH: in this case it’s not that you’re getting a wasm module, but that you're getting a wasm builtin feature.

FM: yeah im wondering if they would be concerned about that

RH: yeah there’s a lot of very odd schemes out there. 

SYG (chat): I don't get the sense IANA is strict about that

TL (chat): Provisional schemes are first-come-first-served with absolutely no checks

AR: what you’re saying is probably true for the web; it's hard to say what other ecosystems might want. Personally I feel uncomfortable using a very broad general scheme like wasm: I think we should use a real URL but  it should be more specific and less broad, something like "wasm-js:"

RH: registering is the big thing that would reduce the likelihood of clashes. So far we’ve prefixed everything with JS in the string, like wasm://js-   we could continue that. It’s a little difficult since we already have it in the JS API. it would be nice not to have different pathnames between the JS API and ESM; I would prefer to keep it the same scheme and prefix the paths.

AR: You're still clobbering this very broad scheme name. Is the concern that this has already shipped in the JS API and we can’t change it?

RH: We could change it for ESM. For backwards compatibility with the existing JS API, we'd have to have 2; it would be different between the ESM and JS API. if we registered this, we could use it for things other than the ESM API; we would manage it like a namespace as the CG

DSchuff: Registering the scheme with IANA lets us do whatever we want with it. It doesn’t lock us into using or not using a particular design with ESM, so  I would be in favor of registering the scheme while we continue the discussion in the CG.

RH: what if I tried registering both wasm:/ and wasm-js: ?

AR: that sounds good.

RH: no guarantee of success, but it gives us flexibility.

DG: no concerns, just wanted to express that it’s better if the CG registers this, it reduces the likelihood of future clobbering.

DSherret (chat): Instead of wasm-js: maybe it could just be a path under it wasm:/js/ ?

TL (chat): That’s pretty much what we are doing today :) 

JK (chat): no concerns. I think renaming would be viable too though.

ZB(chat) :could we extend the spec and prohibit using "//" right after wasm: ?
