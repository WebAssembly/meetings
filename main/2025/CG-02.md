#### Getting to the venue
The event will take place at the [Fastly San Francisco office, 475 Brannan, Suite #300](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nptQ3JZcyZQiZotd9).

The Fastly office is within walking distance from the Caltrain stop as well as T and N train stops.  Due to the general unreliability of traffic in SF, transit, walking and/or biking may be preferable.

There is a buzzer to the right of the main entrance, to be let into the building.  

##### Arrival on bike
There is a free bike cage in the garage that opens at 7:30am and closes at 4pm.  After 4pm, the guard at the front desk of the 1st floor will let you in.  Please enter through the garage only (no bikes allowed through the building lobby) and let the parking attendant know you are attending the Fastly event. If he is not on the garage floor, he will be through the door at a payment booth.  The attendant will show you the bike cage.  Please bring your own lock.

##### Arrival by car
There is a (paid) garage at 475 Brannan St.  Please stop by the parking attendant to pay when you enter.

#### On arrival
After entering the building, take the elevator to the 3rd floor, and the entrance to the Fastly reception area will be on the right.  If arriving after 10am, text Luke at +1 (817) 919-5583 and heâ€™ll run up to the door and let you in.

Badges will be printed at the reception area and need to be worn at all times in the Fastly office.  Fastly policy requests that attendees take a COVID-19 test before attendance.
