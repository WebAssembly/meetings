FM presenting [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fO-337XvUZR9iyP6o10RuZPfbYYh2i4vUloOGVMOw1s/edit?usp=sharing)

CW: you mentioned the web API tests: given that this isn’t core language, are there any other tests we want updated to reflect this?

FM: I believe the tests are in the right place.

CW: we have what we need in other standards orgs too?

FM: yes.

KW (chat): Non-critical question: Do we think there will eventually be a followup proposal with a Wasm analog to script-src (which I know was debated years ago and abandoned in the MVP), or is this basically not going to happen at this point? (https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy/blob/e3977ba46d540c5ae6e628626e70c8d95ce93f9a/proposals/CSP.md#using-existing-csp-script-src-policies)

FM: this was discussed a while ago. I don’t rule it out but there seemed to be a lack of enthusiasm for this in the WebAppSec group. They seemed to want their own policy type as wasm. I’m not really against it but the community said that script-src was meant for executable code, and wasm is executable code. Script-src isn’t specific to JS. So I guess it could happen but doesn’t seem likely.

FM: so let’s have a vote for phase 4 at this point
