### Proposals and discussions

### JS interop API for Custom RTTs [#2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-rtts/issues/2)

TL presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Okj-P5hoqUMbAT4BgPXsQYLho05hHNUo1wlX-KybPIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

RH: clarification: Is it only prototypes that we care about? I assume there’s other things we want to configure, e.g. fields reflected as own properties?

TL: Prototypes are the most important. Calling methods is the most important use case. But also because own properties can be emulated with getters/setters on the prototypes. But yes, prototypes are the most important. If we can get that it would be a good start.

RH: Makes sense. The reason I brought it up is that all the constraints you brought up are likely to also apply to these other integrations as well.

SYG: Can you explain how struct.new_desc_with_host solves the immutable shape problem?

RH: new_desc_with_host initializes the field marked as descriptor, and takes an extern ref that engines that can interpret. It could also be an options bag.

SYG: So this is for programmatically making a new shape, not instances with a shape. So with the current alternatives, the shape is declarative, not programmatic like this?

TL: Yeah, we've talked about how we want a declarative solution. I think we do want some kind of imperative way to do this that we can layer some declarative solution on top of, haven't talked about that. If it is just a custom section that can be lowered or polyfilled onto the imperative thing, or some other solutions.

LW: How bad would it be to allow constexprs to call imports?

TL: Would require a more general notion of compile-time imports. We sort of have that for string builtins.

LW: Can't globals currently refer to values known only at instantiation time?

TL: Yes, good point, a previous declared or imported global.

LW: Otherwise, calling an import form the JS API to construct a descriptor from a prototype seems like a good solution

TL: channeling andreas: a function call is not a constextpr

LW: Neither is an import. But you can say for a fixed value of an import, then the result is constant. Same for the result of a function

TL: The benefit of keeping constexprs constant and pure is that it allows lots of implementation strategies. I don’t know how this is done in practice. If everyone is doing it the same way maybe we could just standardize that.

RH: I think you could still do lazy instantiation. My fear about doing global init is that [... ]

CW: Why is it important that this goes in this way …

TL: vtables today are always globals. Many of the described objects are also globals. So it's important to keep that. If you have the init function in the start function, it requires the prototype slots to be mutable. So Luke’s idea, that you import a function that produces the descriptor, replaces struct.new. It does everything struct.new does and also attaches the prototype, so it’s a host concern

CW: It seems like you’d need to build a lot of type reflection on the JS side to know the shape of the struct.

TL: Yeah maybe. Or maybe it's a magic import and the imported function isn’t reflected on the JS side.

CW: Or just make it a builtin.

TL: We still have the problem that we can’t call them in a global initialization.

CW: If we model builtins as a form of compile-time import, it's less of a stretch to put them in constexprs.

SD: I don’t think we’d need an external function to actually create the descriptor, just the prototype object given and the chain. After that you can use the machinery we have.

TL: You’d still need to identify which operand of the struct.new is the prototype when you allocate the descriptor.

SD: True, it seems an easier problem to solve.

TL: Maybe. How would you solve it?

SD: You are close to that with the new_desc_with_host instruction. Seems easier than JS understanding the descriptor shape.

TL: If you do that, then you don’t need the new function at all. You can just import the prototype as an externref. Same for any solution for identifying which operand is the prototype.

LW: If we try to avoid constexprs calling imports, then the performance problem isn’t that you’re mutating prototypes, but that the global is mutable and nullable?

TL: The problem I was talking about is a little deeper. Not the mutability of wasm-visible field but the engine internal prototype slot in the shape

LW: if the RTT wasn’t created until the start section, it’s created then and the reference to it would be nullable.

TL: I see, you don’t allocate until the start section. It would work, but would be much more difficult to layer a declarative version on top of  arbitrary start section stuff. I would expect that would also have not great performance characteristics.

JK (chat): We expect applications to have tens of thousands of prototypes, and (in total) hundreds of thousands of methods on them. Which leads me to believe that once we have performance data, we will strongly desire a declarative solution for setting all that up. For lack of alternative, I assume that will mean some sort of section. So I think it'd be most useful to focus our solution-finding on: what kind of section can we agree on? E.g., as a rough concept: how about section IDs >= 1000 are "host sections", specified in specs that are layered on top of core Wasm?

LW: Could the bulk method be a single function that takes and returns an array?

CW: Would you still need to set every global then?

TL: Probably, unless you keep the vtables in the array and reference that every time you use them in the program.

TL: I would like to talk about custom sections, since that’s where we started. My mental model was that the prohibition on semantics in custom sections applies to core wasm only, and that beyond that, anything should go. If you look at LLVM’s linking section, it doesn’t go to the engines, but certainly it has semantics interpreted by the linker. So it’s expected that tools assign meaning to custom sections and that affects the execution. So it seems OK to me to put JS specific stuff in a custom section.

SC (chat): Is the custom section that bad?

RH: 2 concrete things besides: in the JS API custom sections get reflected into a byte array. It would be nice to avoid that if you're trying to use it as a normal section. Also validation is pretty lax, where if you get a byte wrong, it's just dropped silently. So I think we’d need to fix those, so that makes it more a different kind of section, so i’d lean toward figuring out what that kind of section would be.

TL: Yeah, JK said before, what if we have a “web section” that’s layered on top of core Wasm, sort of like the component model. I'm not sure we want to layer stuff on core wasm just for the web. Spec goals aside, how would it compose with CM, etc. But it’s a reasonable way to think about it. A section that only makes sense for JS engines, assign real validation to it and have JS engines error if it’s wrong, and not reflect it. But the encoding could be a custom section wrt core Wasm.

CW: The version of the custom section I'd be ok with is imagining we solved the problem with JS APIs, then specified the custom section to do what the APIs would do. Are we there with the current custom section design or is it more magic than that?

TL: The original design is a little more magic because the custom section sets up the association between the prototype and the described object and there’s no JS API fallback to that. We could specify a JS API and a custom section, where the API performs worse, but that doesn’t seem too satisfying.

CW: I'm not imagining we’d actually do that API, but sort of specify it as if it were.

TL: Yeah we would specify in the JS embedding API and spec it algorithm style like we have.

CW: Yeah it could have the same limitations, e.g. can’t inspect parts of the wasm that aren’t exported.

TL: Yeah not punching a hole in the abstraction, with a hook, all we need is to require the vtables to be exported. Then we can do the internal magic in the JS API. I agree that’s a good goal. To keep the abstraction boundary.

CW: Maybe run his concept by Andreas. He’s the most picky about this.

SD: Another idea: on the idea where we have empty prototypes. What if we automatically create a prototype chain that follows the subtype relationships of the heap types?

TL: Good idea except that at each level of the wasm type hierarchy there could be many descriptor objects for each type, it’s a funky thing about the structural type system. Each descriptor could describe many source types.

SD: true, we even do that…

TL: If you had some way to declare which descriptor of the supertypes you should form this chain with, it would work, but it comes down to how do we pass that info into the engine.

TL: For next steps; the documented API in the overview has some issues so we’d like to change it. I'd be happy to document multiple alternatives there for now but of course for an initial prototype we need to pick one. My ideal would be to take the custom section approach and try to make it as palatable as possible and flesh out details, but there are alternatives like the imported functions thing. It seems less clear how to make that work and achieve perf goals, we could look into that in parallel. Is anyone so strongly against the custom section thing that they think it’s totally a waste of time?

CW: I’m in favor of a version of that as I described, where it’ as-if it were a JS API.

LW: On that, one tricky thing is that if it’s framed that way, and you want it where you don’t mutate the prototype, you have the case where you allocate something with a prototype and pass it out to the outside world, then it's exposed before you initialize the prototype. 

TL: Hopefully the JS spec can accomplish this. But I guess the start function is run as part of instantiation

CW: Is your concern that the JS API can do too much, because things leak out?

LW: yeah you would like to do it before the imports are supplied to avoid the problem, but then you can’t. A perennial problem is that the exports aren’t visible when you call imports at instantiation time. For bulk init, it wouldn’t be crazy to initialize N globals from an array.

TL: The problem is that if we do it as if the JS API were fixing exports, then if we allocate a descriptor in a global, and the start function could pass it to an import, then the import can observe whether the prototype has been attached to the global and if the engine attached on allocation, it’s observable. Whereas if you spec where it only attaches to exports, then you will observe no attachment in the start func.

RR (chat): Technically, the JS API is perfectly capable of rewriting the binary before compilation such that the start function becomes a normal export, doing its magic, and then manually calling the renamed start function. Super hacky, but if it's only in "conceptual space..." … not that I *like* that solution.

TL: Yeah. More thinking to do here. What’s the minimal invasiveness we could get with a custom section. And if we say no invasiveness at all, does it just go back to calling a builtin. So that seems like reasonable next steps, seeing what the section could look like under different constraints.
