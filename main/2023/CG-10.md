### Scheduling constraints

Please add any scheduling constraints here, especially if you're not able to travel, but would like to contribute to one of the agenda items. If you are adding a scheduling constraint, add the agenda item you are interested in attending, and timeslots that would work. Adding a constraint doesn't guarantee that we will be able to accommodate it, but we will attempt to make sure interested folks can attend and contribute. 

Jérôme Vouillon: I would prefer to give my presentation on Thursday.

## Meeting notes
