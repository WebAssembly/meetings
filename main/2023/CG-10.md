### Registration

Fill out this registration [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFUvB3MC9GNMuOMlN8Iab499xW30NaoxRgMWVjRwo9wLrbNQ/viewform?usp=header_link) if you will be attending in-person or virtually. Registration will close on September 29th, 2023.

### Logistics
#### Getting to the venue
The event will take place in the [Munich Google office, Erika-Mann-Straße 33, 80636 Munich, Germany](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D1qhzzZtwGH6YY1Q8).

Coming from the main station, you can take the tram lines 16 (direction "Romanplatz") and 17 (direction "Amalienburgstraße") every 5 mins and leave at "Marsstraße". From there you can cross the street and continue walking across Arnulfpark and you should see the Google building from there. You can also take any S-Bahn train (S1-S8, approximately every 2~mins) from the main station in the direction of "Hackerbrücke" and leave at "Donnersbergerbrücke". From the platform, walk backwards from the direction of travel, walk up the stairs, turn left and exit the pedestrian bridge. The Google building will then be to your right.

If you come straight from the airport, you can take the S-Bahn trains S1 or S8 (it's their respective final stop, so there is only one direction to go) and leave at "Donnersbergerbrücke" as described above.

There is no guest parking at Google and public parking spots are sparse around the office. So we don't recommend going there by car.

#### On arrival
After entering the inner yard, turn right in the yard and go to the reception where you can pick up your guest badge. If the door is closed, ring the bell and they will open for you. Someone from the organization committee will wait there for you and lead you to the conference room.

#### Meals
There will likely be some catering provided by Google. Details are to be defined and will be posted here.

### Proposed agenda items (to be scheduled)

Please add any scheduling constraints here, especially if you're not able to travel, but would like to contribute to one of the agenda items. If you are adding a scheduling constraint, add the agenda item you are interested in attending, and timeslots that would work. Adding a constraint doesn't guarantee that we will be able to accommodate it, but we will attempt to make sure interested folks can attend and contribute.
