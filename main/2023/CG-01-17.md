### Discussions

#### Tail calls to phase 4

BT: Talking about an overview of the tail calls proposal

BT: Engines that implement it: V8, JSC, interpreter, this is the last requirement for Phsae 4. Formalism is updates, and toolchain has implemented. 

JSC with the last implementation

CW: Are we going to need a follow-on with return_call_ref? 

TL: Maybe we can include it in the GC proposal

AR: Func types proposal, it’s in the reference interpreter inn that repo, its implemented there and the spec is updated, bunaryen implements it, V8 implements it. 

RH: How does LLVM use this right now? 

TL: LLVM in LLVM IR, you can have calls that have must tail calls, they are required to whatever the target thinks the tail calls are. Otherwise the backend throws a fatal IR, so it’ll error out. There are also …, For C++ in particular the codegen for co-wait/co-yield, in clang produces must-tail calls, so clang will fail to compile down to tail calls <TL to fill in>

RH: Does that just do return call or return call indirect as well? 

TL: Not sure, guess is yes, it can do tail call analysis and then use that not entirely sure. 

AR: Regarding return call_ref, once we’ve landed this whenever we add a call instruction in the future, we can have a companion return call instruction - they should always come in pairs.

FM<in chat>: I am very excited about tail call. But, If I recall, the interaction with EH was not addressed

AR: What interaction specifically?

FM: The wording in the tail calls doesn’t mention EH, and EH doesn’t mention this either, what happens if the last call in the try block is tail called?

AR: We have explicit instructions for tail calls, not a syntactic feature, being last doesn’t matter, but question - is a tail call allowed at all in a try block? Unless there are concrete difficulties with implementation we should allow it

FM: It won’t be caught by the handler in V8

AR: it looks like that would be correct, equivalent to a return followed by a call

FM, Ok, came across it, and wanted to highlight it.

CW: Remaining question: Does the wasm level semantics match what LLVM expects?

TL: No idea, guess is yes

CW: Exception handling should probably handle this, because this is going to phase 4 first. 

AR: Unlikely that any practical codegen would need this, if they do the backend should somehow fix it up

BT: Should we do the poll then? Any other thoughts or concerns? 

**POLL**

Only 10 years to get this through! 12, if you count JS. Tail calls to Phase 4! Congratulations to all involved.
