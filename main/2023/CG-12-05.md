### Proposals and Discussions

#### Threads subgroup charter

Form to sign up to attend subgroup meetings: https://forms.gle/3MvUwqiyCFGAAfmC8

TL Presenting [Threads subgroup charter](https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads/pull/21)

TL: Briefly, last time I was presenting the scope, scope is large enough, we want a dedicated forum for topics related to that effort, the plan is to reuse the meeting slot from the GC subgroup, drafter a new subgroup - copy pasted from the previous charters and updated to refer to threads and thread topics and deliverables. The scope is syntax, new instructions, TLS, synchronous sharing, type system extensions … etc. as in the charter. 

No new specification deliverables beyond the usual specs that the CG makes. Also includes the usual suites of tests
Looking for a consensus to form this group.

CW: are we naming sugroup chairs now too?

TL: I volunteered to be subgroup chair, Conrad and Andrew will also be co-chairs of the subgroup. Coincides with the champions for the shared everything proposal

Asking for unanimous consent, any objections?

[no objections]

Since it’s a new subgroup, we’re starting from scratch with a new Zoom meeting, please sign up with this form, the link is in the notes. The form just asks for your email address, to confirm that you’re in the CG. We will start meeting in January.


#### [Frozen proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1493),

PC Presenting [slides](TODO: PC To add slides)

FM: Why do you include the non-null part in the freezing? You may have a null value - you want to know the value is null in the frozen value. IF you don’t include the null check, you can do this in constant time that has the same representation of the value

PC: if you don’t check for null in the phases,

FM: Not about the phases, when you have a normal value and a frozen value, the difference is that none of the frozen values have nullable values and none of the nullable values have frozen values, why do you have the second condition?

PC: if you want the immutability, you need to prevent mutability from the old version, you need to say the old version is inaccessible, can’t be modified. So im not sure we can avoid converting the value.

CW: How necessary is the phase order? It seems to me like a nested module - would we be able to get away without adding it? E.g. if you could move the second phase into a second module that gets evaluated later?

PC: I suppose yes, it would be very similar

CW: I can see the value of the freezable and the frozen extensions, the phases messes a little bit with the nested modules story in the future. 

PC: if there were nested modules, i would be happy to do it that way.

DG: pause for questions: we can do a unanimous consent poll, since this seems in scope and could be valuable, and the threshold for phase 1 is low. 

objections?
[none]

FM: who would be the champion of this?

PC: I suppose one of us could do it. If anyone would like to help or take over, that would be fine

FM: I suggest you take it, a proposal needs a champion to move it forward.

DG: we do usually assume the person proposing would be the champion unless there are other arrangements

Proposal moves to phase 1, exact name TBD

RH:  is there an idea how this could be extended for shared GC values, if there’s a freezable bit, is there a potential concurrency issue?

PC: Certainly would be concurrency issues, haven’t thought about it-  but I wouldn’t expect mutable threads to want freezable values, and wouldn’t be surprising for it to be very expensive, you could be smart and use the order of freezing operators, but I would go for the simple version and mutex everywhere. 
But I don't see why there would be specific problems otherwise.
