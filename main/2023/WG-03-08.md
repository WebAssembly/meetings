AR: what’s the current status / next steps for Wasm 2.0?

### Tail calls to phase 5

DG: status/updates from Apple re: rolling back of tail calls?

JM: Safari doesn’t have a working impl of tail calls; current impl is from a contributor but has serious flaws.

AR: Is it tractable?

JM: Yes, but it’ll take more work/time.

DG: Mozilla interested but not done yet.  But do the requirements require shipping vs. “implemented” to some degree?

AR: Shipping doesn’t seem required per the process.

JM: Not against, happy with the spec.  Just not done yet.  But do impl hurdles suggest any challenge?

DG: Maybe lets use the email mailing list to get status from Apple/Mozilla?

Ms2ger: Is there pressure to get this shipped right now?  In a month or two might have a clearer situation.

AR: This would get delayed indefinitely as it’s not a high priority. Not sure when we’d ever resolve it

Ms2ger: That’s an argument against it if we don’t have enough priority to ship this

PP: Did it linger this long b/c Chakra objected?

AR: No, that was resolved.  It just didn’t get prioritized yet.  But perhaps we should consider age of proposal.  But maybe we shouldn’t set a bad precedent here.  Is just the compiler working and can you turn off the interp to consider it a working impl?

JM: The only blocker is prioritization, no concern about being able to implement it.  Spec seems unobjectionable and small in scope.

LW: Wasmtime is working on an impl actively.

JM: That would make us more comfortable knowing that is coming.

DG: We may have already shipped (b/c Phase 4 and we have a working impl).  It doesn’t really change our shipping status.  But I have to check if it’s shipped for sure.

AR: I think it’s fair to ship at Phase 4; that means it’s feature complete.

JM: This is fine, we don’t want to set a precedent, and given how noone’s objecting to it. It’s not unreasonable to say this in particular is special

AR: I was going to suggest we work on 2.1, which will include extended const + tail calls, but we should probably wait a little bit more on that. Getting back to the earlier point of 2.1..

LW: Plh here! 

AR: Question is what the current status of 2.0 is? What’s left to be done and any AIs? From a W3C process

PLH: We have to start the horizontal review process, and it needs a published review, Wasm is special needs LaTex
* Publish working draft (dated, stable)
* Email out for horizontal review (horizontal groups: privacy, security, accessibility etc, in practice this takes 3 months)
* If everything works, then we ask the director to move to a candidate review
* Implementation report is after the CR (protections kick in). How do we demonstrate we have implementations, if we have a 
* Proposed recommendation, we have to demonstrate that we have implementations


EP: We can use old Sphinx workflow, it works but process not so automated, some manual text editing required

DG: I wanted to confirm (above)

DG: Can we use our webassembly.org status page to demonstrate implementation status?

PLH: Yes

AR: From our end, everything is done for ~1 year, nothing left to do that we know of.

PLH: Only thing is holding us back is complicating tooling to deal with Latex in the draft to convert and thanks ericP for being here.

EP: Bikeshed doesn’t offer hack that we did previously, need some manual manipulation.  Have other specs changed at all?

AR: not in major ways

EP: Publication would involve all three, reproduces the sphinx portions, puts in a W3C headers, adds page numbers, and some highlighting

AR: that’s the script you put together? And that should still work?

EP: Hopefully, two points of volatility, one is the python portion, and the other on how it interacts with the Dom

PLH: If it would only use MathML

AR: We want to get rid of Sphinx and not LaTex, we are dependent on Mathjax

AR: Who owns the next steps?

EP: Having a pair who would work with me on this?

PLH: Once we have a Working Draft, we can just stick “CR” at the top and that’s it.

AR: Then we’re in an evergreen model where we can just push a button to publish a new build?

PLH: We have groups automating this via GitHub already.

AR: Can we have that (help getting that working)?

EP: The only thing manual is to tweak the version/revision number, very easy to automate.  The sphinx2tr is in a W3C repo.  Other scripts are easy to grab.

PLH: Call with Eric so he can hand off?

AR: Is there anyone we can recruit for that?

DG: Let’s take it offline to email thread
