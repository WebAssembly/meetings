### Charter
MS: We did get one comment on the draft: https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/pull/4

MS: TPAC delayed the progression intenerally, but the process is first to discuss with the W3C staff, I’ve done that. The changes were all editorial (other than adding the component model). There have been changes to the charter template. I had not initially used that but now it is, so if there are any changes from the last charter, they are from the template.
There was also the addition of a bulleted item for stack switching. 
So the substantive change was the addition of bullet items for stack switching and the component model, and for normative changes, the addition of the component model.

I have approval from the rest of the W3C team for progressing this to W3C management for final approval, once it gets that, then it goes to the advisory committee for review. I don’t recall exactly how long that review is, could be a few weeks. But likely it won’t be complete until about a month from now. We do have a charter extension through the end of october or november. If that kicks in first, we can actually publish. The charter is the thing that’s preventing us from publishing in the TR space (we can do github.io, but not on w3.org because we have to be chartered to do that).
Actually the AC review is 28 days. So we can get another month extension if we need to.

AR: we have a face to face meeting next month, after that I expect that we will want to make another doc cut soon (3.0?) since there’s a bunch of stuff that’s accumulated. I’m not sure its worth pushing 2.0 all the way through?
There’s a lot of editing work to do, resolving merge conflicts, editorial stuff, that will take a while.
So I’m wondering how much work the acutal procedure is

MS: it’s an issue if we change the shortname URL. if we want to version a different version in TR space, that’s more work. If we just want to overwrite what we have so the short name remains the same, that’s doable.
The runtimes are unversioned, right? We dont’ have different versions fo the runtime for versions of the spec?


AR: people complained that there were multiple runtimes and no spec versions, it was hard to say what was supported with no versions, so we decided to have versions even when we publish on green. But the next version will be a large change, we should probably bump to version 3 at that point, but it’s open to discussion. Seems like the right thing to do messaging-wise.

MS: that’s orthogonal to the charter discussion, the group can do what’s best for the users. If you want multiple versions in TR space you can do that.

AR: I take it that it will be significantly faster to push 2.0 first then, better to get something out there ASAP:

MS: yeah it does sound lke it.
So the only substantive comment that we go ton the charter was from Anne, and he’s here, do you want to speak aobu that?

AVK: we reviewed the proposal internally and I think a couple people got confused when they saw component model, and they didn’t really know what it was, as a normative deliverable. They want to know what it would be for webkit and the web platform, hard to know what would be in scope for this. And there’s no links, it’s not clear what it would mean. There’s a legal aspect too.

LW: yeah, most of the other things have a sort of meaning already. The component model doesn’t really. Maybe we should have a brief description?

AVK: yeah I don’t think it’s changes since we discussed initially

LW: yeah it doesn’t add capabilities to the web platform, it’s just a way of describing compute, and can be polyfilleed with wasm. Should we highlight that it’s not adding any capabilities or web interfaces?

AVK: I assume it will be implementation work, even in a browser implementation of wasm. It’s not clear yet whether it would be worthwhile, and how it fits with other features

LW: yeah part of that is that thats where the stage process kicks in, it currently needs browser support in order to progress. I don’t expect browsers to implement this soon because tehre are more important things. But the charter lets us work on a single standard instead of runtimes outside the browser do their own thing, which is happening now. When browsers implement is an orthogonal question:

AVK: typically you expect a WG charter to have deliverables that you expect to complete in some number of years, right>

MS: my advice was to put in anything in the charter that we believe that we might get done in the charter period. If somehow the component model got escalated to where a year from now we have a spec and implementations, if it were not in the charter we couldn’t publish a spesc fo rit. Teh standard charter period for WGS is 2 years, but I”m asking for rechartiering for 3. They may say only 2 but I asked for 3. So if it’s 3 there’s a real possibility that well be ready with the spec for this in the chartering period.

AVK: yea i guess it makes sense and as Luke said it still has to go through the sages in the CG, it doesn’t matter quite so much.

MS: some of the other informal feedback was a question of, how much of this applies to browser runtimes? I said everything. The core spec is agnostic to the browesr runtimes. The web API is specific to browers, but there’s nothing that’s not applicable at all. Including the component model? Although it does seem like its a bigger priority for non-browser, the anticipation is that it will eventually in browsers. That will matter to the AC reviewers. Should we say that the CM is expected to be implemented in browsers? Would be to pre-empt asking and make it clear, but also the sense of scope for the implementers.

AR: I kind of expect that eventually we will have something that’s not relevant to browsers. It seems inevitable. Should we consider that a problem? Should we set a precedent earlier rather than later? How should we prepare for that situation?

MS: it’s hypothetical at this point. We talked about WASI and the chairs thought that we didn’t want to put WASI in the charter, so we left it out. But I do think there are W3C stakeholders that have less interest in what happens outside the browser. If the focus of a group is seen as primarily working on stuff where browsers aren’t a priority, then the group might be less of a priority for some AC members. 

AR: yeah I don’t expect that we get to a point where the majority of things aren’t relevant, but there might be a few things that aren’t. The group as a whole i assume would still be interesting. WASI does seem weird since its’ a decent size effort

LW: the challenge of WASi si that its a bunch of different things. We don’t want to just make a blank check to add any kind of API. we’d need to list specific things and it’s too early for that. E.g. sockets would be a big problem for browsers, but is very useful outside. Also our stage process will need to be adjusted before we can really get it. It’s still early and we’ll need discussion. Whereas the CM is pure compute, can add value or be polyfiled today. The reason for the charter might be like ESM, where browsers didn’t implement it for a long time, but there were polyfils and the standard was useful. So we want a stable thing that people want to produce, that can be useful even if browsers don’t prioritize. So we want to break the chicken and egg where browsers won’t implement until users want to use it, but users won’t want to produce it until there’s a reason. So I wouldn’t want to try to get a firm commitment to ship it, but we’d like to at least get to where it could happen, no objections on general principle.

MS: you mentioned the blank check thing. We can’t have things in the charter that are so broad that it’s an escape hatch to do anything they want. In practice, the company lawyers that review charters will call it out, you have to be more explicit. About WASI, it’s imaginable that if some standard is published related to wasi, its not necessary to publish at W3C. some other organization or no standards org the way you need for wasm; it’s possible. It could be W3C but doesn’t have to be. If there are specs targeted for other runtimes. We could still do that, theres nothing that prevents W3C groups from publishing things that aren’t targeted at browsers, there are other groups that do that. But wasm is both for now. But eventually if we want to put some things in a new charter that aren’t planned for browsers we could still do that.

AR: some clarity on granularity: is it more on the doc level or could it be that every proposal has to go intot he charter? 

LW: roughly the latter in the current charter, there’s a bullet that has e.g. stack siwthcing, GC, etc

AR: that does seem a bit inflexible, what does that mean if we introduce new proposals.

MS: if we come up with a proposal that’s not explicitly mentioned in the charter, it wouldn’t matter until we wanted to publish a first public working draft. The AC would review and we could get feedback. If they felt that it was radically different we’d get that feedback.

AVK: it’s always possible to recharter. You need to just strike a balance between the scope that you set, and pushback that ou might get

LW: realistically for WASI we aren’t in danger of going all the way to WG in 3 years

MS: the current scope seems accurate for the reviewers that we have.
For the CM, I can minimally add some links. I can add some langauge, if LW could help with that we can just push a couple of changes

LW: happy to help. To get clarity on what we want, do we want a self-contained description in paragraph length? Or something other format?

AVK: I think a paragraph elaboritng is fine. But it’s also fine for things to be links, you could link to explainers and there would be the sense of scope

LW: so they don’t need to be totally self-contained. 

AVK: yeah thats what you see in other groups.s e.g. webappsec WG. they have text blurbs and links

MS: ok so minimally we can add a link for CM. we could also do this for other things too, e.g. you mentioned threads. We can look into adding more links.

MS: I’m available on the wasm discord, and the charter is in a github repo: https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/blob/gh-pages/2023/wasm-wg.html

PP: will there be some discussion in the larger W3C after this? Sorry, missed the beginning of the meeting.

MS: it will go to the advisory committee with all the company reps, they have 28 days to comment or object. If there is an objections then well respond to the comments and resolve. But hopefully it won’t happen.

AVK: since the charter deliverables are essentially gated on the CG process, it might make sense to tsay the group “may” deliver these things, since it might not happen

LW: that could be a general clarification, say that these things we will attempt to hand down via the CG process, and the WG will consider after that.

MS: at this point I think there’s no link in the charter to info about the CG stages. So maybe that could be helpful. In normative specs, we do have stuff we’ve already published and say we’ll deliver new revisions of those, and it also says we “will” deliver these other things. We could say “may”.

LW: yeah we could mention in “deliverables” and reference it later in the CM

AVK: yeah if LW will do a PR we can just review and discuss it there
