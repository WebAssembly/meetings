### Vote to approve acting-chairs Bailey Hayes and Pat Hickey as new chairs of the WASI Subgroup

LC: I have chaired the WASI subgroup for 2+ years. Less time recently for chairing - BH and PH have done amazing job, want to make their chairing official


CW: Unanimous consent poll: would anyone like to object or raise any discussion?

<no objections>

CW: unanimous consent passes, thanks and congratulations to both, we look forward to working with you


### Reminder: upcoming typed function references and GC phase 4 vote (Thomas Lively)

TL: Just wanted to let everyone know that 2 weeks from now we have a scheduled vote to move the garbage collection proposal to phase 4. The requirements have been met, there are few outstanding spec PRs but we have tests, implementations, implementer feedback has been very positive. It’s the result of a lot of work by a lot of people, we are excited. Just wanted to make sure it was on everyone’s radar since it’s a big deal for a lot of folks here.
There will be a presentation by Andreas reviewing the proposal, changes, etc. but I would urge anyone interested to look at the MVP.md doc in the repo. But I can also take questions now.

LW: Has anything interesting happened or changed in the proposal in the last 2 months or so?

TL: we did finalize the opcodes and reshuffle them. Maybe not that interesting. The last big design question we talked about was a detail about the type annotations on br_on_cast and br_on_cast_fail. We had an input  and output type annotation, the question was whether we should constrain it so that the input type was a supertype, making it a proper downcast. The answer was yes, it will be validated to be a proper downcast. We initially thought that would be very hard to ensure in Binaryen during optimizations, to ensure that the refined input type is still a supertype. But we found a simple solution, so it became a non-issue. Other than that it’s been stable.

FM: If you’re not participating in the GC group, it’s a bit hard to find out exactly what is being proposed.

TL: yeah, like most proposals we have an overview document, but it’s a bit out of date. The correct doc to look at is the MVP.md doc: https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/MVP.md

FM: can you update that?

TL: yes

Chat (JM): Note: tpac is scheduled that week (Sep 11-15), so browser implementers may not be able to attend

CW: are there any browser implementors here that want to say anything, or object?

RH (chat): I will be able to attend.

JK (chat): I will also attend.

JM: I won’t be here (PTO). I don’t have any objections, just wanted to raise it.

JK (chat): for the record, "Typed Function References" will also have its Phase 4 vote in two weeks. (It was split out from the GC proposal years ago, but the two ended up progressing in sync with each other regardless.)

TL: I’d be happy to roll them into one vote, if that’s acceptable according to procedures.

CW: We can roll them together, and if it fails we can figure out what to do.

TL: The tools have a single flag to turn them on and treat them as a single feature.

TL: thanks, and check out the proposal if you’re interested.


### Presentation: Prototyping stack switching for Wasm (Daniel Hillerström)

Slides: https://dhil.net/research/talks/wasmfx-cg2023-08.pdf


TL (chat): If wasm-opt did support WasmFX, would you expect it to be able to noticeably optimize the hand-assembled benchmarks?


PP (chat): An I understanding correctly that you are wrapping all types into u128? If that is true, can you speak of any overhead associated with that?

FM: I was under the impression that you’d improved the performance, Surprising that you’re still slower than asyncify?

DH: yeah we haven’t optimized yet, we did some refactoring and it slowed down. I think we can recover that though, will talk in a couple slides. In the tree case it’s faster

FM: you said you didn’t want any memory leaks, but my understanding of the proposal is that theres a builtin memory leak because you still have a pointer to the continuation after?

DH: you refcount the continuation, you keep a reference alive in a stack and if you don’t invoke it, you leak the memory

DH: (to TL):  yes I think so, the assembly isn’t too optimized, especially inlining might help. And maybe loops? So I’d expect to see something, but I don’t think its the main source. There’s low hanging fruit we can get in wasmtime. Like to build something correct first, and then optimize it. 

DH: (to PP): yes there’s a massive overhead to that. Its unfortunate that it’s typed but we can’t take advantage of that in wasmtime. We want to put an i32 into a regular register and can’t right now, so it impacts performance quite a bit because we pad everything

PP: if you just disabled SIMD somehow, could youi try it without that would it help?

DH: yeah we could use 64 instead of128, it might help. Was cheaper to get a functionally correct version first, didn’t want to prematurely optimize. Just to avoie getting trapped too early on in a local minimum. There’s definitely low hanging fruit that we can get, and maybe better integration with the tools. I don’t have a good feeling yet for how much.
We also need better benchmarks, more of them and better representative of real code. More realistic workloads to get a good evaluation.


TL (chat): Do you have an idea of how deep the call stack needs to be for WasmFX and Asyncify to have roughly the same performance?



CW: have you looked at current use cases for JSPI: is it getting generated by a compilation process that could be used for case studies?

FM: dart did have an experimental implementation of async on top of JSPI but they aren’t using it because it’s slow. 

CW: do you know of any other similar uses of JSPI that might also be useful to look at?

FM: there are languages that have coroutines, so those are obvious candidates for all of these proposal. Languages  like Dart/Kotlin, mainstream languages that use coroutines aren’t currently targweting this. They are interested but have other things to do. They have CPS transforms. Emscripten does support JSPI today as well, can use instead of asyncify, and pretty convenient to use. Currently good candidate use cases in emscripten aren’t good candidates for core stack switching (instead they are what JSPI is designed for).

TL: emscripten does have some APIs that use JSPI, e.g. the fiber API. current built on asyncify, would be interesting to implement on top of wasmFX. There’s also a native promise API, a C API that wraps JS promises to write async C code. Might be interesting to see if that could be written in terms of wasmFX.

DH: yeah that would be helpful for getting better performance data.


More questions will go offline.

Questions we didn’t get to from chat:

TL (chat): 
Do you have an idea of how deep the call stack needs to be for WasmFX and Asyncify to have roughly the same performance?


NF (chat): do you have a sense of how much the benchmarks were exercising stack allocation vs stack switching and suspend/resume?

ZB (chat): We are experimenting with JS PI in Kotlin/Wasm, not specific results so far.
And we (Kotlin) would be happy to experiment with stack-switching proposal implementations, as well.
