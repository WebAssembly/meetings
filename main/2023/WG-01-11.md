###  Welcome to Philipe Le Hegaret (AKA PLH)

W3C is a new legal entity (split from hosts such as MIT), unable to keep all the staff. Eric is leaving and several groups are falling back to PLH as their rep.
Also make sure that when groups want to move forward with REC track, that things go smoothly. But otherwise, I’m here to help with whatever the group needs.
I’m also trying to get groups on continuous publication or CR snapshots at least every 2 years. It’s less confusing that way, and covers the patent bases.


### Doc publishing
WG publishes “v2” as an evergreen spec, and stays at v2 without a minor version number. The CG has a minor version that increments.

Eric wrote a sphinx-to-TR tool that uses respec for the core spec. The other 2 specs are in Bikeshed. The latter requires manual editing to get the minor version, but the tool is fully automated.
https://github.com/w3c/sphinx-to-t

Currently there are 2 versions published. V1 is a rec and V2 is a first public working draft.
The plan was to migrate to Echidna next time we merge a proposal.

One question: what to do with the V1 spec? Are there implementations that target that specifically? 
Most implementations should converge.
So probably when we go to CR with V2, at minimum we should make V1 point to the new version.
LW: Does CR mean cutting a particular branch, or making the evergreen one live?

PLH: evergreen means to go to CR and stay in that state, and keep updating. Really the difference between that and working draft is that it has the patent policy. The biggest burden when going to CR is getting all the horizontal reviews.

DS: Yes, I think that’s what we want to do now

PLH: We should try to do this through github, track it through issues

LW: probably we can use a tag in the spec repo.

PLH: will create an issue in the spec repo to track what we need to do to go through the process. First will be to republish a working draft to determine exactly what will be reviewed.

EP: Might also be worth trying to get the echidna pipeline working with that too
