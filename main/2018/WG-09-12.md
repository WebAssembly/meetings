## Meeting Notes

### Introduction of attendees

* Ben Smith
* Ben Titzer
* Conrad Watt
* Gordon Aplin
* Ulrik Sorber

### Proposals and discussions

BS: Brief description of current status of Working Draft. The proposed document
is available as a PR against the spec repo. Includes fine-grained changes,
found by diffing HTML between editor's drafts and previous working draft. In
the future we'll want to provide more coarse-grained changes for proposals, but
this is fine for now.

BT: Are there any deadlines to be aware of?

BS: No, the only real deadline is that we are required to put out a draft at
least every 6 months, or say why we didn't. But we still have a month or so.
There is no deadline for the CR, since we're already long over the time were
"resetting the clock" would make a difference.

BS: Putting out the new WD is the path the next CR. The only real constraint
there is making sure that our implementations pass the testsuite. We currently
do, but if there are tests that are added in the meantime that are
non-compliant, we'll have to redo the CR.

BT: Yeah, there are some issues with the implementation limits in some engines.

BS: Are those in the document?

BT: I handed that off to Dan Ehrenberg, not sure if he's landed it yet.

BS: OK, we may want to wait until that is landed before we push for CR.
