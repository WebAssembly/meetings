### Opening

#### Adoption of the agenda

*Brad seconds*

#### Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)

*JF volunteers*

### Discussions


#### Review of action items from prior meeting

* [Update phases proposals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/163) Brad will review and merge
* [Web-standards meeting technology](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/157) nothing so far


#### webassembly.org maintenance

*Alex Danilo*

webassembly.org was maintained by Seth, but he went to grad school. Now unmaintained. [See doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTG4BtIETf1wkZ5Xq3OHAKadv-hi13p7_CGHfBon9Yw/edit#heading=h.16it8hze90l7), provide feedback. We’ll revisit next meeting.


####  Future in-person meetings

Confirmed:

* April 10-12
* Fastly SF office
* 475 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94107

At least half-day, maybe full-day, WG business on Thursday.

Agenda coming soon: https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/main/2018/CG-04.md

No topic yet, let’s fill it out over the next few weeks.


#### Rename memory operations

*Ben Smith*

       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/627
       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/649

Let’s table and discuss next meeting.


#### Layer 1 encoding proposal

*Katelyn Gadd*

* https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1180
* JF / Brad: good start, interested in getting other people’s inputs.
* Lars (speaking for Luke) isn’t impressed by brotli wins, expected something like macros for layer 1.
* Katelyn: yes, there’s more that can be done.
* Keith: how do macros work?
* Katelyn: *explains*
* Keith: risk of over-fitting compression to what modules look like today, not tomorrow?
* Katelyn: yeah, but tradeoffs with macros versus streams, want to avoid baggage. Ideally most effort is on the compression, so browsers don’t have to change too often.

*AI:* Brad to ping tooling people, as well as Brotli people.


#### Discussion of Anyref + Host-Bindings

*Brad Nelson + Andreas Rossberg*

* Discussion of reduced host-bindings proposal.
* [Gist](
https://gist.github.com/rossberg/be5962c37e5e749285272622f52b4223)
* Potential simplification of host bindings we we peel this off.
* Opaque, doesn’t require GC, could be refcounted.
* Could make host bindings much simpler.
* Might require more type checks, lose some perf, but expect minor.
* JF: want to make sure non-web embedding also tries this out.
* Tyler: Fastly is interested in trying this out.
* Limin: difference with host bindings proposal?
* Brad: used to conflate levels, and allocation / pre-allocation of table slots.

**POLL:** We can (at champions’ discretion) create a separate 'anyref' repo to hold a Phase 0 proposal that peels off anyref + Table(anyref) from the GC / managed objects proposal.

*Unanimous consent*

*AI:* Brad to circle back with Andreas, choose direction.


#### Content Security Policy

*Eric Holk*

[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13WYycQqqegM5B_G7gRtQpD6CfBvcEy9yGobRtio6A1E/edit#slide=id.p)

* Discussion on use cases for and behavior of `'wasm-eval'` source directive
* https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/pull/293
* Need to have a WebAssembly + webappsec meeting to get to an agreeable design.

*AI:* Brad to set up joint meeting. Anyone interested should reach out to Brad.

#### Annotation syntax for the text format

*Andreas Rossberg*

       * Provide generic notation to represent custom (section) information in text format

*tabled since Andreas not here today*

**POLL:** We should create an `annotations` repo to hold a Phase 0 proposal to define annotation syntax for the text format.

#### BigInt/i64 JS API integration

*Daniel Ehrenberg*

* https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/707
* New JS proposal for arbitrary-sized integers. Now at Stage 3.
* Could now map i64 to BigInt in a JS embedding.

*POLL:* make a new repo for BigInt/i64 JS API integration.

*Unanimous consent*

*AI:* JF to create repo and tracking issue, with Dan as champion.

* [repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration)
* [tracking issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1186)
