### Opening of the meeting

### Introduction of attendees

### Find volunteers for note taking (chair to volunteer).

Brad Nelson to take notes.

### Adoption of the agenda

JF Seconds.

### Discussion on status of the Working Draft.

#### Status of exclusion periods

Timing on patent exclusions in First Public Working Draft
150 day window.
It's currently 97 days since Feb 15. 53 to go.
New items start separate 90 days clocks on the diff.
We are obligated to publish a new draft or explain why every 6 months.

#### Including Mutable Global

It has come up that we shouldn't knowingly publish something that's going to be incompatible.

JF in the CG I'd heard some objection about not having things not in the MVP.

JF: I'm swayed by Luke's argument.

AI: Let's have a poll on the agenda.

AI: Next time let's poll on Mutable globals begin ship worthy.

AI: Add a standing item to the agenda on general ship worthiness.

### Update on Brad Nelson

Brad Nelson is leaving work on the Chrome team, as such we probably should select a new chair who will be directly involved going forward.

Brad would like to propose Ben Smith, but we didn't give notice on this agenda.

Also Brad needs to investigate the process around a proper hand-off.

### Future meetings

### Confirm next meeting date + time.

In the interest of accelerating the hand-off, Brad might like to have a meeting in a week for the transition. On the other hand it might take longer to sort out. Brad asks the group for his discretion on scheduling next meeting (1 week or 2 week). It is suggested we could have a one-off *special* meeting so as not to break the cadence we have.

Luke thanks Brad for his service as chair.
