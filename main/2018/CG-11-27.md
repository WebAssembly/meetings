#### Review of action items from prior meeting.

SS: I opened an issue that I'd like to discuss. https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/915

SS: There is WebAssembly.Module.customSections it returns the custom sections
with those bytes. The names are encoded in utf8, which is specified in the wasm
spec. There is an API that uses a separate decoder. It looks like that whatwg
decoder has special rules. I found some tests that are linked in to the issue.
From the wasm point of view it is one section, from the JS point of view it is
two sections.

BS: It has to do with how to handle the replacement character?

SS: Yes.

BS: So the question is how to resolve?

SS: It's inconsistent. You have to add special rules.

BT: What you're saying that the decoding of wasm is different than the JS one?
Or all others?

SS: Just the JS one.

BS: So the WhatWG decoder converts 0xdc01 to 0xfffd?

SS: They are both way higher than the upper bounds, so they should be equal.

BT: Do you know if the implementations don't match this?

SS: Yes, v8 doesn't pass.

BT: We can do the same thing to match JS and wasm interpretation.

BS: I think this may be a JS thing vs a web thing.

BT: Ok I think this may require follow-up offline.

AI(SS): follow up on the GH issue.
