### Proposals and discussions

#### Review of action items from prior meeting.

#### [Rename memory.drop and table.drop](https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations/issues/23)

JP: I like `drop_segment`. It keeps it under the same table label.

AR: Bikeshedding but I would call it data.drop and elem.drop or `table.drop_elem` `memory.drop_data`. No strong preference

LW: Nice symmetry with data and elem, those are the things you’re dropping.

BS: [Trying to find consensus]

JP: Would like it to stay under table if it affects tables.

AR: But it doesn’t.

BT: I had another bikeshedding discussion. Dropping passive/active and renaming to autoload for active.

AR: What’s the opposite called?

BT: Absence.

BS: Yeah active/passive is not great, but else would we call it. Don’t like noautoload.

LW: The text format can have “auto” and nothing otherwise. Or maybe use lack of init_expr as passive.

LH: Things are becoming ambiguous in the text format already with multiple tables, I don’t think we should push our luck.

BS: The default now is active, so you want to keyword for passive.

BS: Seems like there’s not a lot of interest in bikeshedding, let’s follow up on GH issues.

#### [Revisiting the edge-case semantics of wake](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/108)

AR: This is not just for the spec semantics. It removes an edge case. In realistic cases you can `UINT32_MAX`. In unrealistic cases you shouldn’t use anyway, because it would trap anyway. There’s no benefit from the current case split, so we should simplify.

BT: How do you do this if you want to wake > 2<sup>32</sup> with these new semantics? Wake in a loop.

CW: Current semantics don’t cover this either.

BT: You could encode this as 31-bit int with another bit for “more waiters”

LH: You can already do this by adding a “num waiters” instruction.

CW: This is an unrealistic case, linux, windows, etc.

LH: This isn’t just OS threads, also asyncWait.

LW: Is it possible to have wait trap instead of wake?

CW: Would we say that the max number of waiters is 2<sup>32</sup> then?

That implies we that we specify that we can never create more the 2<sup>32</sup> waiters.

LH: There’s a poor interaction with JS -- they’d have to agree to this limit.

LW: Engine could just do it.

LW: You probably wouldn’t have made 2<sup>31</sup> waiters, and …

LH: Trapping is poor semantics.

LW: We already have to trap on grow.

LH: grow is single-threaded

LW: `memory.grow` is multi threaded though.

CW: Whatever we need is going to require more instructions.

Can we use the unsigned semantics given that we’ll have to add more instructions anyway.

BT: The semantics aren’t quite right, don’t want it to be a loop for “all”

[Discussion about resource limits]

LW: `table.grow` has to stop before the length fits in the i32

AR: Now that you mention it, there is weirdness with `table.size`, it’s 32-bits which is 1 more than you can index.

BT: You should be able to index the last one, oh you can’t have a full 4G table.

TL: Why don’t we have `wake_all` and doesn’t return how many it woke.

LH: It’s a ridiculous corner case, and nobody likes any of the solutions.

BS: In the past we punted on these decisions by adding traps. Maybe we should do the same as LW mentioned.

CW: So it sounds like semantics are preventing > 2<sup>32</sup> waiters, and using unsigned for wake.

BS: Any issue for TC39 that we’re introducing this limit?

AK: This doesn’t seem like an issue for TC39, there are many limits like this already in the spec.

Poll: trap wait > 2<sup>32</sup> and unsigned semantics.

JP: bikeshedding wait vs notify.

CW: We’re not doing the same as JS, wait takes nanoseconds in wasm, JS uses a float. So it’s different.

AR: I like wake/wait.

JP: I ran into the confusion, in a conference talk and 1-1. It’s easy to misunderstand. Nice to have a different name to have it different from JS, not a big concern for me. Notify is easier.

BT: I’ve never seen wake used before, always seen notify.

LH: Came from the futex interface in linux.

[discussion about TC39 history here]

LW: Oh, so JS renamed it to notify?

BS: Yes, they did it after all browsers unshipped because of spectre.

LW: So it has the benefit of being in alignment with JS and clarity when speaking.

Poll: Rename `atomics.wake` to `atomics.notify`

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 15 | 5 | 2 | 0 |

BS: Two people against, do you want to say anything about why?

AR: Already mentioned before (like wait/wake pairing, and no reason to follow JS)

MR: Wasm is it’s own language so it doesn’t need to follow JS.
