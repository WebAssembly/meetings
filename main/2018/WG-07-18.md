### Discussion on status of the Working Draft.

BS: Discussed timeline for working draft w/ Eric, our w3c rep. Havenâ€™t seen many
change to the spec since the April review, aside from mutable globals and
removal of indexeddb serialization, so CR and PR will be mostly the same. PR is
typically the time for implementation feedback.

KM: So MVP feature list or v1 feature list?

BS: w3c PR requires two implementations, which we will have for v1 (Chrome +
FF). Some small formatting changes. Will work with Tab + Andreas to get CR
ready in August. Given a candidate recommendation at August 14, the proposed
recommendation is September 25 and w3c recommendation would be October 30,
which aligns nicely with TPAC.
