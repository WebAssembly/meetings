### Opening

#### Adoption of the agenda

Pat seconds.

#### Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)

### Review of action items from prior meeting.

* SIMD is in background work. Brad will report. Integer SIMD may be ready by April.
* Tail call: no updates. Can add as option to proposal. Some people oppose this. No discussion since in-person meeting.
* Exception handling: ongoing work.
* CSP: Google talked to Mozilla, trying to move forward. Some CSP experts on the hook. Apple folks like their approach.
* [CSP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy/issues/1) and [associated PR](https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy/pull/6) 
* JS embedding tests: Dan started.
* WPT: nothing new.
* Browser limits: JSc updated their values to more closely match V8. Lars says Mozilla has a question about number of locals (did sum of params and locals). Ben Titzer will update proposal in spec repo.

### Discussions

#### Update on [WebAssembly atomics](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads)

Browsers are disabling SharedArrayBuffer due to Meltdown / Spectre, what does it mean for the WebAssembly equivalent?
[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18rPEUBROVvQUpE9asjWvR__xpskzRgEUq2MnYuUkZBc/edit#slide=id.g2d4d39b8a2_0_72)

*Brad gives summary of attacks*

SAB can be used as a high precision timer (count on one thread, witness updates in another). There are other sources of timing in browsers. Brad presented a very early design that would re-enable SAB with much caveat (extra processes and such). Discussion about what other browsers think, it might be possible to just re-enable as-is.

“Our long-term plan is to make Spectre impossible even in the presence of high fidelity timing; further work is needed to re-enable this path.”

[Proposal](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBdsq1_DfOCCD-AY_Fa3XoEcgSsFCNR4aBX9W7jkiCw/edit#)

WebAssembly atomics are basically tied to SAB at this point. Waiting to figure out Spectre mitigations before talking about enabling.

Split some simpler subspecs out of the threads spec and let them land sooner? 

1. Sign extension opcodes
1. Mutable exportable globals
1. Programmatic data initialization

**POLL** pull each of these 3 items out into their own repo

*unanimous*

Discussion on feature testing of these features once split up. Threads could require all 3, and testing can just be pessimistic.

#### Discuss upcoming in-person meetings

April would be a good time (Andreas would like early).

Fastly might host in San Francisco.

August timeline after that.

Google Munich would be able to host afterwards, in summer.

Igalia could host as well.

Zalando could also host, either Germany or Finland, maybe in November.

*Luke pointed out the following after the CG call endded* If WebAssembly has a presence at [TPAC 2018](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2018) (October 22-26, in Lyon, France), we agreed last time we should reuse that as an in-person meeting opportunity.

#### Future VC meetings

Keep meetings bi-weekly, and rotate times.

Send invites in UTC.
