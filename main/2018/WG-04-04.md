## Discussion: Should we drop the APAC timezone video meetings? (Brad Nelson)
       * POLL: We should drop the APAC timezone meeting.


Eric: Is a little odd to pull the meeting at a non-APAC meeting.

Brad: We brought it up at the last APAC meeting and no one objected there, we waited until this one to have a vote.

Eric: We could do one off ones if folks suggest it.

Conclusion: Chair will drop the APAC meetings for now unless someone that feels strongly contacts him.

## Discussion: Could we simplify the meeting signup process? (Brad Nelson)

Eric: Link at the end of the form sounds fine.

## Future meetings
       1. Confirm next meeting date + time.

AI: Brad to add an agenda item for testing video conferencing at the in person meeting.
