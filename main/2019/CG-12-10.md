Updates from Deepti

Next face to face to be hosted by Google in San Francisco Feb 11. Please fill [registration form](https://forms.gle/AkFcWeiVn9QqHJte7) to attend.
We also have a WebAssembly contributors summit Feb 10. Participants and speakers need to register (free event) but the registration is only open for a few more days.

WG update: our current charter expires in 2020. We have to choose what kind of standard we want going forward (living standard or with discrete versions). If you are interested in participating in the discussions about that, let us know.

KM: are CG members more likely to get into the contributors summit?

DG: don’t know, this is more of a developer focused event. But we also want to be able to mix between users and developers of the standard.

Update from Ross Tate on research efforts around GC

RT: We’ve been working on the GC proposal, it would be useful to have more discussion with the broader group, focused on use cases. There’s the existing proposal, and we would have to decide what we want to do going forward, or resolve existing discussion. We wanted everyone interested to know that this was going on, 

We’ve set up a link to find a time that works for everyone (http://whenisgood.net/wasm-gc-mvp-intro).
