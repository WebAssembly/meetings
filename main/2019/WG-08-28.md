### Merges

- The [latest js-api change](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/commit/666dc4cb8d4a81d386a7a716000bb85fbbbd06a2) is present in the CR document
- The [Upgrade to IEEE 754-2019 (#1050)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/commit/a221f2574d7106e92cf8abaf05d5bb1131b19d76) just updates the IEE754 reference to the most recent spec -- doesn't change implementation

The rest of the PRs are typographic or for the interpreter, which is not a CR-related product.


### Issues 

- [Published jsapi spec is out of date](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1059) -- no textual change; related to github pages.
- [OCaml Dependency is Problematic for Windows](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1048) -- interpreter

### Wide Review

CR followed a wide, in-depth section-by-section review from CG members, as reflected in spec [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Awasm-core-1+)
