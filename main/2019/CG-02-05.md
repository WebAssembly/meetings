#### POLL: to merge wasm-constants.js and wasm-module-builder.js? [WebAssembly/spec#963](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/963)

SS: Is it OK to split merge these?

BT: I think it's ok, folks shouldn't be depending on it

LH: It's a private import in FF repo

BT: It's a test artifact, if we want we can make it into something more useful
for others. It'd be nice to separate out, but unless we do that I don't think
we should worry about breaking it.

BS: So is everyone OK merging these?

[Unanimous decision]
