### Proposals and discussions

#### Share SIMD 64x2 benchmark results ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WNtU2VZuKSAx-RHwsFlZH-rrWiuf4BiAp4GK8CiolkA))

Zhi An Ng presenting results. 

PP: How can we share benchmarks?

Z: Benchmarks can be shared by creating an issue on the repository. 

PP: Mersenne Twister seems to work out of the box

#### Replacement for "☃ Bindings" ([webidl-bindings/#47](https://github.com/WebAssembly/webidl-bindings/issues/47)) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l93PWXlFZOUP6DZouknNM41sVyfPfFYXhqebqiNLdtw))

Luke Wagner presenting slides.

LW: Has been discussed on our bindings video chats but we wanted to bring the results to the CG.

Poll: rename the proposal to “Interface types”

FM: is it possible to have a space in the name?

LW: we use a hyphen, for convention on github

RT: Interfaces are between different things. It sounds like this is for interop between wasm and other systems. Would something like “interop type” be more specific?

LW: that was one of the things we discussed.

RT: sounds good, let’s not repeat it.

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 7 | 10 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

RT: been talking with our researchers. If we get the CG proposal done, every memory access will be safe. So we’re interested in hardware improvements if we know we have this property. Is anyone exploring this already?
Currently there’s a lot of stuff to guard against bad memory accesses. GC would have the property that every access is guaranteed safe. So you could remove HW protections if you have this guarantee.

RW: I’d be interested in understanding more. I’m not exactly clear on the specifics yet.

RT: We’ll include you

PP: I’m interested too

DP is interested also.
