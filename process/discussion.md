# Constructive CG Discussions

The intent of this document is to encourage positive, and constructive discussions
in the WebAssembly CG. This document contains a non-exhaustive list of guidelines
to nudge discussions towards positive outcomes.

## Tone

- **Keep discussions factual and non-judgemental**

- **Avoid passive-aggressive language**  
  It can be helpful to identify sources of frustration, but it is often best
  not to post while actively frustrated to avoid letting that frustration turn
  into passive aggression.

- **Avoid patronizing language**  
  For example, implying someone is ignorant (e.g. "This is common knowledge in
  <technical community>; I’m surprised I have to explain this") or feigning ignorance.

- **Avoid asking rhetorical questions**  
  Phrase questions in a way that advances the discussion. For example,
  Instead of asking “Have you considered X?” When you know X has not been considered,
  write up an analysis of X yourself or to ask "What happens when you consider X?"

## Content

- **Acknowledge the validity of different use cases and priorities**  
  This makes conversations more inclusive and avoids unnecessary arguments about
  differences in points of view that fundamentally cannot be resolved.

- **Ask clarifying questions**  
  When someone's comment is unclear, it's better to ask for clarification or
  confirmation of your understanding than to make assumptions about what they meant.

- **Provide constructive, actionable feedback**  
  When providing feedback on an idea, avoid broad generalizations, and provide
  concrete examples where possible.

## Conversation management

- **Take conversations one step at a time**  
  It can be reasonable to provide a full chain of reasoning in a single comment,
  but don't ask others to respond to the conclusion without giving them a chance
  to respond to the steps that led to the conclusion first.

- **Keep conversations focused**  
  Threads have different purposes such as brainstorming, bikeshedding,
  consensus seeking, etc. Create new threads for new topics or new purposes
  of discussion.
  
## Conflict resolution

- **Resolution through vote at a meeting**  
  In case of prolonged disagreement, consider bringing the issue up at a relevant
  subgroup meeting where applicable, or to the CG meeting so the issue can be
  put to a vote.

- **Resolution through implementer feedback**  
  In cases where progress is blocked, and consensus looks unlikely, feedback from
  compiler, tool, and engine implementers can be a useful resource to
  provide actionable next steps.
