# Hosting a WebAssembly meeting

Any organization can volunteer to host a WebAssembly meeting. Simply contact
[the chair](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) or bring up the
possibility at a meeting.

It is the intent of this group to hold meetings where participants are located,
not just in the Bay Area.

Locations should have the following characteristics:

* Near an airport, easily accessible from major travel hubs
* Near a hotel
* Meeting room sufficiently large to host 50 people
* A single-layered circle or square layout is ideal
* Whiteboards and markers
* Bathrooms near the meeting room
* Accessible to people with disabilities
* Electricity to all seats
* Wi-Fi
* Presenter's podium with projector
* Telepresence system
* Area for attendees to step away for phone calls or meetings
* No required NDA from attendees
* Provide light snacks and beverages throughout the day
* Have lunch options, paid or not, nearby
* Sensitive to dietary requirements, a vegan option is required

The host is expected to:

* Pay for the meeting location as described above (usually a single room,
  either in a company's meeting space, a hotel conference center, or
  academic institution's teaching room), including snacks and beverages.
* Provide travel information for attendees (airport, transportation options,
  hotel list, visa requirements). The host is not expected to pay for any of
  these, but can negotiate group rates.
* Be available during the meeting to help attendees get in and out of the
  location.

Optionally, a dinner can be organized by the host. Alternatively, a local
sponsor can separately cover the cost of the dinner.

A list of attendees will be provided to the host ahead of time.
