# Attending a WebAssembly meeting

Meetings are held in-person at the location determined in the meeting
invitation. The invitation will contain logistics on location, time, address,
parking, nearby hotels, Wi-Fi, and host contact. This invitation will be sent no
later than 2 weeks before the meeting, through a pull request on the
[meetings repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings) as well as
through an email to the Community Group's mailing list.

It is expected that a small breakfast, snacks, and beverages will be offered on
premise, either for free or for a reasonable fee. The host may organize a dinner
as well. If a dinner is held, the host may require RSVP ahead of time.

All attendees are required to be members of the
[community group](https://w3.org/community/webassembly/) prior to attending. Further, we
request that attendees register in advance so that the host may plan capacity
accordingly and so that the meeting notes may record who was present.

The host must not request that an NDA be signed by attendees.

Sometimes it may be impossible for an expert to attend the meeting in-person. In
such cases, it is requested that the expert write down their feedback ahead of
time and nominate someone to represent them in-person. In rare cases it may be
possible for experts who are very involved in a proposal to attend a subset of
the meeting remotely. In such circumstances, the expert should contact the chair
and host, specify for which agenda items their presence is required, and arrange
a time for them to call in.
