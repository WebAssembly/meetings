# Attending a WebAssembly meeting

Meetings are held online every two weeks, and in-person as needed.

To attend a meeting:

- All attendees are required to be members of the
[community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) prior to attending. 
- All CG meetings have PRs in the [main meetings directory](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/tree/main/main)
 **To register, send an email to the contact listed in the meeting's
  associated PR.**

## In-person meetings
For in-person meetings, we request that attendees register in advance so that the host may
plan capacity accordingly, and so that the meeting notes may record who was present. 

The meeting invitation will contain logistics on location, time, address,
parking, nearby hotels, Wi-Fi, and host contact. This invitation will be sent no
later than 2 weeks before the meeting, through a pull request on the
[meetings repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings) as well as
through an email to the Community Group's mailing list.

It is expected that a small breakfast, snacks, and beverages will be offered on
premise, either for free or for a reasonable fee. The host may organize a dinner
as well. If a dinner is held, the host may require RSVP ahead of time.


The host must not request that an NDA be signed by attendees.

Sometimes it may be impossible for an expert to attend the meeting in-person. In
such cases, it is requested that the expert write down their feedback ahead of
time and nominate someone to represent them in-person. In rare cases it may be
possible for experts who are very involved in a proposal to attend a subset of
the meeting remotely. In such circumstances, the expert should contact the chair
and host, specify for which agenda items their presence is required, and arrange
a time for them to call in.
