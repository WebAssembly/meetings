# Virtual WebAssembly Meetings

The full group meets in video conferences biweekly. The usual schedule
(as well as information for joining the VC) can be found on the offical
[W3C Calendar](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webassembly/calendar)
but there is also a Google Calendar event that is kept up-to-date
e.g. in the event of cancellation. Contact the chairs to be added to it.
The agenda and notes are kept on GitHub in the 
[meetings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/tree/main/main) repository.

There are also several subgroups that maintain their own meeting
schedule and agenda. A 
[list](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/subgroups.md)
is maintained and their minutes are kept in top-level directories in the meetings
repository.

All attendees are required to be members of the
[community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) prior to attending.
