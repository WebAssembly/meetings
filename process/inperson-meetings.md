# In-person WebAssembly meetings

In-person meetings are organized typically 1-2 times per year, and are very
valuable for high-bandwith conversations and informal interactions between
participants.

## Attending in-person meetings

For in-person meetings, we request that attendees register in advance so that 
the host may plan capacity accordingly, and so that the meeting notes may
record who was present. 

The meeting invitation will contain logistics on location, time, address,
parking, nearby hotels, Wi-Fi, and host contact. This invitation will be sent
in advance of the meeting, through a pull request on the
[meetings repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings) as well as
through an email to the Community Group's mailing list.

All attendees are required to be members of the
[community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) prior to attending.
The usual
[WebAssembly code of conduct](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md)
applies to in-person meetings as well as surrounding events and online
interactions.

## Hosting in-person meetings

Any organization can volunteer to host a WebAssembly meeting. Simply contact
[the chair](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) or bring up the
possibility at a meeting.

It is the intent of this group to hold meetings where participants are located,
not just in the Bay Area. Meetings usually last 2 or 3 days, during working hours.

Locations should have the following characteristics:

* Near an airport, easily accessible from major travel hubs
* Near a hotel
* Meeting room sufficiently large to host 50 people
* A single-layered circle or square layout is ideal
* Telepresence/videoconference system accessible for remote participation
* Whiteboards and markers
* Bathrooms near the meeting room
* Accessible to people with disabilities
* Electricity to all seats
* Wi-Fi
* Presenter's podium with projector
* Area for attendees to step away for phone calls or meetings
* Provide light snacks and beverages throughout the day
* Have lunch options, paid or not, nearby
* Sensitive to dietary requirements, a vegan option is required

The host is expected to:

* Pay for the meeting location as described above (usually a single room,
  either in a company's meeting space, a hotel conference center, or
  academic institution's teaching room), including snacks and beverages.
* Provide travel information for attendees (airport, transportation options,
  hotel list, visa requirements). The host is not expected to pay for any of
  these, but can negotiate group rates.
* Commit to the dates sufficiently far in advance that attendees can secure
  any visas necessary for travel to the site.
* Be available during the meeting to help attendees get in and out of the
  location.
* Not require that an NDA be signed by attendees.

Optionally, the host can sponsor lunches, and/or organize a dinner; these
are sometimes sponsored by the host or a separate sponsor arranged by
the host. An RSVP may be required ahead of time.

A list of attendees will be provided to the host ahead of time.

## Day-of event process

### Agenda

The meeting invitation contains an agenda which will be updated through pull
requests in the days leading up to the meeting. Champions for individual
features are expected to provide details of their proposal in a timely fashion
so that attendees may review the material ahead of time. Champions are also
expected to provide a list of questions on which attendees will be polled for
[consensus](consensus.md). Some meetings may have an overall "theme" which
guides which proposals should be discussed in that meeting.

Attendees are expected to familiarize themselves with the proposals before the
meeting. It is not acceptable to stall the meeting due to lack of preparation.

### Notes

Notes are taken throughout the meeting by designated note-takers (who may
change throughout the day). Names of each participants, their affiliated company
/ institution, and what is discussed, are recorded in the notes. This
establishes where ideas came from, and how they came about. Before posting the
notes publicly to the meeting document, the notes are sent out to attendees to
verify correctness and allow clarifications. Notes are subsequently posted to the
meeting document.

[Consensus](consensus.md) is recorded in the notes.
