# Overview
GitHub is the primary location for the development of WebAssembly, along with
the Community Group meetings. The CG has a GitHub
[organization](https://github.com/WebAssembly) which any CG member can join.
Several different types of repositories are hosted there. Examples
(non-exhaustive) include:

- [spec](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec): WebAssembly specification documents, reference interpreter, and test suite.
- [design](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design): Design documents and general design discussion
- [meetings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings): WebAssembly meetings (VC or in-person), agendas, and notes
- [proposals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals): A tracking list of WebAssembly proposals
- [website](https://github.com/WebAssembly/website): The sources of [webassembly.org](https://webassembly.org)
- [tool-conventions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions): Documents for conventions supporting interoperability between tools working with WebAssembly.
- A repository for each proposal. For general spec proposals, these are forks of the spec repository with the proposed changes applied. 
  WASI API proposals have a separate [template](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-proposal-template). For example:
    - [gc](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc): Integration with host garbage collection facilities
    - [memory64](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64): 64-bit memory support
    - [js-promise-integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration): Integration with JavaScript promises
    - And many others (see the proposals repo for a full list)
- A few repositories with shared code projects
    - [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen): Optimizer and toolchain library
    - [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt): Low-level wasm binary toolkit
    - [wasi-libc](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc): C library implementation on WASI
    - And a few other projects and test suites
  
# Administration
The GitHub organization is managed by the CG and subject to the same
decision-making processes as proposals or other CG activity.  It has several
organization owners (for redundancy and to cover several time zones): these are
usually the CG/WG chairs and spec editor.

Any CG member can be a Member of the organization. Being a member allows you to
be selected as a reviewer for PRs, easily @-mentioned in discussions, and a few
other practical conveniences, but otherwise doesn't confer any special
permissions or status.  Members will be added on request (contact
webassembly-cg-chair@chromium.org with your name and GitHub ID).

Repository ownership and committer status are determined for each repo
individually, depending on the nature of the repo.  Proposal repos are owned by
the proposal champions; the spec repo is owned by the spec editor; the meetings
repo by the CG and subgroup chairs; software projects by their respective
maintainers; other repos default to the CG chairs.  Commit permissions on
repositories can be given by the owner to any CG member based on a history of
contributions and/or expectation of future contributions. Again, this is a
practical consideration and not a special designation for decision-making
purposes.  Contributors may have permissions revoked (e.g. if they are inactive
for a long period of time) as a matter of routine security practice, but can be
restored as needed.
