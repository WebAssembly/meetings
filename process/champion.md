# Responsibilities of a Champion

Champions are authors and editors of proposals. The champion is responsible for
the evolution of the proposal from Phase 0 through Phase 5; at Phase 4
maintenance transfers to the WebAssembly Working Group (WG). Champions have
admin permissions in the proposal repository. Periodically, champions may bring
their proposal to the [Community Group (CG)
meetings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/) to ask for consensus on
phase advancement.

When asking for advancement, the champion is expected to make the whole
proposal accessible for review by the CG, by explaining its contents, providing
supporting documentation, etc. Material changes should be presented explicitly.

It is often beneficial for champions to keep the CG updated with periodic
status updates outlining major changes in the regular [CG
meetings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/). While minor changes can be
made through discussions within the repository or the relevant subgroup,
substantial design changes may require a vote from the CG so that the CG has a
chance to review the proposal and possibly re-evaluate if the proposal is in
the appropriate stage. Examples include a change to the fundamental assumptions
or structure of a proposal, a decision that has a substantial impact on the
future direction, or a resolution to a contentious issue that is hard to
resolve.

It is not necessary that champions are knowledgeable about every component of
the spec or its implementation, but they are responsible for the general
management of the proposal repository, which includes:
- Keeping track of issues in the proposal repository and mediating them when
  necessary. When discussions are contentious and hard to resolve, champions
  are expected to wrap them up and suggest the next steps.
- Responding to issues or PRs in the repository, or letting other people with
  expertise take care of them, ensuring that all important issues are
  appropriately addressed.
These responsibilities may be shared with subgroup chairs in cases where there
is a relevant subgroup.

Champions” section in https://tc39.es/process-document/.
