### WebAssembly/JS integration specification (Daniel Ehrenberg) (5 minutes)

* DD: Yay!  Excited about use of Web IDL and Bikeshed

### JS/wasm modules integration (Domenic Denicola)

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11tHsNh2U9oEJD4lvV7XX2M22JnyeyyCHj1ncmspXjBU)

* KM: Toolchain integration?
* DD: Mostly this would be work around establishing toolchain conventions.
* LW: Some work on this already with SystemJS and webpack folks.  More work ongoing.

* MH: Adding new core types for TypedArray in slide example?
* LW: No, these come with the JS Binding Section proposal.  Concrete proposal forthcoming from Brad

### State of WebAssembly tooling (Derek Schuff and Alon Zakai)

#### Updates from Derek
* General status:
* Emscripten MVP support is pretty complete. It also still supports asm.js.
  * Emscripten has JS loader and module interface code, as well as some JS/Wasm interop/marshaling tools (e.g. embind, WebIDL binder). These are just libraries and conventions, it would be good to ensure they work well with proposed module/JS conventions.
  * There's been a big uptick in interest in wasm the last few months, reflected in user interest and discussion on emscripten mailing list, new users trying it out, bugs filed, etc.
  * Rust has experimental wasm support currently via fastcomp (but working on switching to wasm backend). Still plenty of library/runtime stuff left to do.
* Current work/upcoming features:
  * Effort to replace asm2wasm pipeline (which uses asm.js “fastcomp” out-of-tree LLVM backend, and converts the result to wasm) with direct WebAssembly backend in upstream LLVM. Performance and feature support is close, and we (Mozilla and Google) are working to stamp out the remaining bugs and blockers. This is mostly a maintainability thing, and will hopefully be transparent to emscripten users, but good for non-C interoperability and other tool authors.
  * Threads support to go along with wasm atomics proposal.
  * Zerocost C++ exceptions support to go along with wasm exceptions proposal.
  * Wasm object files and linking via lld

* KM: Exception handling work going on in mainline LLVM or Emscripten branch?
* DS: LLVM work is in mainline LLVM. Also some work in Emscripten’s non-LLVM parts (e.g. libcxxabi and the JS module wrapper). Some explanation of Exception Handling.

#### Updates from Alon
* Fuzzing and Reducer tools now available!  They’ve found lots of bugs, if you make a wasm tool, you should try them!
* https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Fuzzing

* MH: Does fuzzer work on Windows?
* AZ: Fuzzer does, Reducer doesn’t b/c system call usage.
