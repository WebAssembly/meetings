            1. Discussion on ramifications of performance results.
            1. POLL: Does the WebP port demonstrate sufficient performance
               consistency to obviate concern around performance cliffs?
            1. POLL: Does the WebP port demonstrate sufficient performance gain
               to justify adding integer SIMD opcodes?
            1. POLL: Does the WebP port demonstrate a useful constellation of
               opcodes around a V128 type?
                * For v128.const, v128.load, v128.store?
                * For v128.and, v128.or, v128.xor, v128.not?
                * For v128.shuffle (v8x16)?
                * For i8x16?
                    * splat, extract_lane, replace_lane?
                    * add, sub, mul, neg?
                    * shl, shr_s, shr_u?
                    * eq, ne?

                * For {i8x16}.mul15?
                    * This would be a 15-bit constant followed by a 15-bit
                      shift multiply (to allow for use of MULHI and the arm
                      equivalent which has a different shift).
