    1. Follow-up from the May meeting:
       - Non-trapping float-to-int conversions [merged to the design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/1089)
       - Threads
         * Update `Overview.md` to match CG meeting decisions:
           - Remove float atomics
           - Use 0xfe as prefix byte
           - Add sign-extending conversion operators
           - Remove sign-extending atomic-operators (encoding proposal 3)
         * [Reference ECMAScript Agent/AgentCluster](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/pull/29)
         * [Rationale examples for WebAssembly.Global](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/pull/31)
         * `WebAssembly.Memory` [clarified, and potentially `frozen` buffer](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/pull/32#issuecomment-311175403)
         * Sign-extend: [fix naming and add `i64.extend32_s`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/34)
       - SIMD
         * Added a separate document for the binary encoding of SIMD.
         * Update per CG meeting consensus:
           - Changed the float-to-int conversions to saturating semantics
             instead of trapping.
           - Removed some of the `i64x2` operations.
           - Removed all shuffles and swizzles except for `v8x16.shuffle`.
         * Removed the boolean types. The CG meeting did not reach a consensus
           on the direction to take, so we'll go with the simpler version for
           now.
       - Working Group formation
    1. Adopt [Online consensus](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/pull/18)
    1. Upcoming Kirkland meeting: discuss potential agenda items
      - GC
      - Exception handling
1. Closure
