As voted on last CG video call, the first 2018 meeting will be at APAC friendly
time: 9th January, 11PM Pacific Time. This should also be a decept time for
Europe folks. If this works well we'll keep every third meeting on that pace.

*Ben Smith*

See [WebAssembly/design/issues/1153](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1153)

We currently can round-trip many things in the text format. One of the things we can’t are custom sections. Not just their order, but their data as well. Similar issue with `$` in text format. Talked about having annotation format, but ultimately not really a nice way to say where custom sections should go. Luke suggested we should just have all of them at the end of the file, which everyone does anyways. Technically a breaking change, but we don’t think anyone generates these sections not at the end.

* Brad: in time I’m worried we’ll use custom sections with hints or something that would be better in the middle. We could experiment with a new type of section this way, and standardize later.
* Dan: I don’t really see contradiction with banning now, and trying to experiment later.
* JF: even with evergreen browsers, changing this to allowing only at end, and then back later to anywhere would be tricky. Some binaries would be invalid.
* Derek: I’m mildly against.
* Ben Titzer: same here.
* Ben: how important is it to round-trip? We’re close.
* Derek: we could specify some ordering in the text format.
* Eric: how do we do custom sections today?
* Ben: we don’t.
* Derek: we could write a counter-proposal.
* Ben: I have a basic proposal in the github issue. “This custom section goes after *this* known section”.
* JF: do we foresee known sections being duplicated?
* Derek: maybe, with say multiple memories we could do multiple data.
* Ben: I think it would be worthwhile to not do that.

**AI Eric Holk** mention “hint” section usecase on github.

**AI Ben Smith** write counter-proposal on github.

**POLL: Should we specify that custom sections must come after all known sections?**

*Postponed to next meeting.*
