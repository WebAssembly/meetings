## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. Follow-up from [Kirkland meeting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/2017/CG-07.md)
        1. Mailing list reshuffling:
            - public-webassembly is now for discussions, requires signup.
            - public-webassembly-announce is moderated and low-traffic, auto-signs up all CG members.
        1. TBD
    1. Discuss timing of next in person CG meeting.
    1. Content Security Policy and WASM
        1. Discuss clarifying current tight WASM CSP restrictions
            1. Strawman (for near term):
                * Similar to JF's proposal https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1092
                    * But avoids throwing from promise-returning methods
                      Fails earlier (at compile)
                    * Allows Tables + Memories
                      Has baked in the understanding that we revisit loosening this at some point,
                      likely as modules + WebAssembly becomes clearer.
                    * When under an unsafe-eval policy, all methods are allowed.
                    * When not under an unsafe-eval policy:
                        * Throws a CompileError:
                            * WebAssembly.Instance
                            * WebAssembly.Module
                        * Returns a promise rejected with a CompileError
                            * WebAssembly.instantiate / WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming
                            * WebAssembly.compile / WebAssembly.compileStreaming
                        * Always allowed:
                            * WebAssembly on the global object
                            * WebAssembly.Memory
                            * WebAssembly.Table
                            * WebAssembly.validate
                            * WebAssembly.CompileError
                            * WebAssembly.LinkError
        1. Discuss allowing WASM in more places (in the future)
            1. Strawman (longer term):
                * WebAssembly modules or instances compiled from a Response with
                  a URL set are treated similarly to JS code loaded via a script tag from a URL.
                  Wasm compilation from a Response falls under script-src
                  strict-inline has no effect on wasm compiles as they have no equivalent of inline.
                * The 'integrity' field in fetch()'s 'init' parameter can be used to specify sub-resource hashes at the 
                  request site, equivalent to <script integrity=.
                  Combined with script-src <source-hash>,
                  this allows execution of safelisted resources by content hash, not just URL..
                * There is no equivalent to <script nonce= (or need for it as there is no wasm equivalent to inline).
                * A Response is fine under policy if any of the following hold:
                    * unsafe-eval is allowed
                    * wasm-eval is allowed
                    * It has a URL that is allowed by script-src
                    * It has integrity metadata (piped through from its originating request,
                      e.g. via fetch(..., { integrity })) that is allowed by script-src
                * When a Response is fine under policy all methods behave as currently specced.
                * When a Response is not fine under policy:
                    * Returns a promise rejected with a CompileError:
                        * WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming
                        * WebAssembly.compileStreaming
                * When neither wasm-eval nor unsafe-eval are allowed:
                    * Throws a CompileError:
                        * new WebAssembly.Instance
                        * new WebAssembly.Module
                    * Returns a promise rejected with a CompileError:
                        * WebAssembly.instantiate
                        * WebAssembly.compile
                * Always allowed:
                    * WebAssembly on the global object
                    * WebAssembly.Memory
                    * WebAssembly.Table
                    * WebAssembly.validate
                    * WebAssembly.CompileError
                    * WebAssembly.LinkError
    1. Coordinating spec tests with WebPlatformTests
        1. Discuss advantages / disadvantages of changing source of truth for some or all of Wasm tests to WPT.
        1. POLL: Should we strive to have some version of all Wasm tests as part of WPT?
        1. POLL: Should the source of truth for Wasm Web embedding tests live in WPT?
        1. POLL: Should the source of truth for Wasm JS embedding tests live in WPT?
        1. POLL: Should the source of truth for Wasm binary format tests live in WPT?
        1. POLL: Should we automate the process of commiting Wasm tests to WPT?
        1. POLL: Should we automate the process of commiting WPT test changes to Wasm repos? 
    1. [Presentation on JS/wasm modules integration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11tHsNh2U9oEJD4lvV7XX2M22JnyeyyCHj1ncmspXjBU/edit?usp=sharing), mostly stage-setting (Domenic Denicola)
