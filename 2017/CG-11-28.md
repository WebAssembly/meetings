       * See https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/49, discussion stalled
       * Poll-worthy?
    1. The type of immutable globals exported from instances
       * See https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/73, discussion stalled
       * Basically, either change existing API incompatibly or live with complex API

       * Spec text changed this to i64 but poll at CG mildly in favor of older i32
