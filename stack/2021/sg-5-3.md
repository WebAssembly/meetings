### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

#### A Two-pronged roadmap (Ross Tate) [27mins]

Slides [(pdf)](presentations/2021-05-03-tate-two-pronged-plan.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-05-03-tate-two-pronged-plan.pptx)

FM: Want to note that we’re not backpedaling on stack switching, even if it ships second.

FM: “May” return a promise? Even though JS is not statically typed, individual functions will expect a promise.

RT: Have seen multiple designs; In JS it’s a common pattern to check if a value is a promise and if it is, you await and otherwise you just run with it.

SL: Won’t that be annoying for the caller?

RT: There’s already standard library functionality for handling this.

AZ: In the use cases I know of, the imports could be statically typed as returning a promise or not. Otherwise this looks good to me.

SL: I’m trying to understand what a stacklet is here.

RT: In delimited continuation space, you have a stack which is essentially a linked list of stacklets.

SL: But in JS you only have one stack.

RT: In this setup, only WebAssembly is ever run on a separate stacklet.

FM: We have a constraint that there shouldn’t be JS frames on a stacklet. If a call deep inside C++ calls JS, how does that switching story work?

RT: That calls an import. The engine provides a stub between the actually provided import function and the WebAssembly call and the stub handles the switching back to the main JS stack.

FM: So when you call JS, you’ve already switched out of your WA stack.

RT: Yep.

FM: When you combine lazy loading and stack switching, does the stacklet in the API become privileged?

RT: Looking forward, this should all be able to be done in Wasm directly.

RT: TL, you’re working on lazy loading. Does this extension look good for that?

TL: Yes, we definitely want the lazily loaded modules to be on the same stack as the original modules, but we need to be able to wait for the lazy load to resolve. As far as I can tell, this design would allow that.

SL: Do you anticipate shipping the basic JS API and this extension together or separately?

RT: Together.

AZ: Why can’t calls from one Wasm module to another implicitly use the same stack?

RT: That might work, but I’m not sure. There’s a semantic difference between synchronous and asynchronous imports that return an externref, which might be a promise that either is or is not awaited. The different stacklets define the boundaries of suspended chunks when promises are returned.

FM: Looking to the future, when we’ve done the Wasm side of this, is it going to be possible for Wasm-generated stacklet to be an argument for instantiateAsync?

RT: I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look at the design space.

FM: Regardless of the order of things, we’ll need a JS API anyway, so this isn’t wasted work.

RT: Agreed.

SL: Is this at all controversial?

LW: I was wondering what the logical diff between the JS API you presented and the one I presented a few meetings ago. Wondering how the stacklet concept helps. If there’s no first-class stacklet, you can switch only when you go back to JS, not just Wasm.

RT: My understanding of your design was that it wouldn’t work for this.

LW: The bindAsync is an explicit stack cut point, so everything is explicit and it should work.

RT: Will have to think about this. It’s possible there’s no real difference after all.

SL: Luke, is there a more detailed spelling out of the design in your presentation?
LW: No, it’s all just in the presentation.

TL: It would be helpful to see the two JS API proposals side by side.

FM: If the two-pronged approach sounds good to everyone, that sounds like a good thing to do in a future presentation.

#### A Risk analysis for implementing Stack Switching in V8 (Francis McCabe)

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/114dMzeEdPKC3PeV8_EIo93UP3McfAFxZAQHMTQdBhJQ/edit?usp=sharing) [27mins]

DL: There are lots of places where people make assumptions about the stack growing down or being contiguous, etc. For example a debugger might cut off the back trace when it is not contiguous. There are probably other places. I talked with (???) from the blog(?) and they said that inside Windows they have the same problem with hidden assumptions.

SL: Is V8 deployed in 32-bit environments?

FM: Yes. We’re very concerned about supporting billions of low-end phones.

LH: About control flow integrity, can I copy a stack somewhere else as long as I copy it back before returning to it?

FM: No, because that looks like return-oriented programming.

DL: OSes usually have an exception for longjmp and could in principle have exceptions for safe APIs we come up with.

FM: Windows has a Fibers API, Linux has something similar. It’s worrying that we would have to modify the OS to get stack switching to work on Wasm. That constrains the deployability of Wasm stack switching. On Windows, it seems the Fibers API is not a major supported API within Windows.

DL: That’s right.

FM: It’s deprecated but still there or something.

FM: Would love to hear if there’s anything I’ve missed. In many conversations, things we thought wouldn’t be important turned out to be important.

LH: We should talk about whether millions of stacks is reasonable. If there are that many, then it might not make sense to make them old objects.

FM: This is a reason to talk to lots of language people. Erlang folks were talking about 65k processes. Java’s Loom project anticipates ~1m virtual threads.

RT: We may have to consider multiple notions of stacks for different use cases.

FM: Maybe, but I hope not. The most important thing is to identify the risk factor first, then figure out a solution.
