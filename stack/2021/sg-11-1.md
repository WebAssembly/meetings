## Meeting Notes

###  Wasm with typed continuations continued (Sam Lindley)


SL: Cover some of the same ground as before.
Show the basic idea scales

FM: can you explain why the design looks like this and not another design one could have had

SL: can't imagine every other thing

FM: imagining a shift/reset style

SL: the canonical other way of doing it in research community doesn't involve any of the tags around. You have a way to create new continuations, suspend and resume, control and prompt are the constructs you typically have. Instead of suspend, you have control, rather than a tag, you pass a function that appears in the block. Key difference in design here is that the code you want to run is specified in the handler, in those blocks, rather than specified at the point where you do the suspension.

FM: why is the difference there?

SL: from programming POV, separating out interface from implementation, the other way of doing it is conflating the two, here we have it teased apart.

FM: differs on that point, am interested to know why the design looks like this

SL: we can encode the other style in this by defining a tag called control, have done that. Allows us to simulate the other style without these tags. The types get more complicated, rather than here where you define just the ways you do control you're using, you need a generic way. Wasm requires us to keep track of types in stack, that ends up being more complicated and messy.

FM: to summarize, if you have a non-generic way of doing things, then it simplifies the types you need to write down

SL: generic stuff okay, end up with complicated types. Doesn't reduce expressive power, when doing simple things, the types you write down is simpler

FM: this code is impossible for a regular compiler to generate from regular programming language

BT: a list of tags and how they map to labels, looks like a try catch, but there's not a value pushed onto the stack when you land on that labe.

SL: there is, when you do suspend, suspend is just like throw, you get a payload. The diff is suspend you get the return value back, for throw you don't.

BT: in exception proposal there is a rethrow, hidden value you can't see, there's not one here right?

SL: you can suspend again, same value you have before

FM: no equivalent for rethrow

SL: you don't need that

AR: you have the continuation which is first class, you don't need rethrow.

SL: FM what do you mean a compiler can't generate this?

FM: resume is the biggest issue. No language construct that maps to resume. No possibility for a compiler to construct one of these from their source language. Has to be done by hand.

SL: most pressing need is to implement specific features like async/await. You don't have to write much code at all for these features, e.g. lightweight threads.

FM: it is a sketch of it and it works, not what you actually need

SL: in a real implementation you have other considerations about performance and other ergonomics. If you want to implement the feature, this is all you need. Something with the semantics of lightweight threads.

FM: some languages like Java have a join operator

SL: wasn't saying to implement lightweight threads for a certain language, but for a lightweight thread feature, this is all you need. A higher level point, this is designed as a target for existing feature. If you have a more flexible language with effect handlers or delimited control, you can compile into this.

FM: Java has Loom project, allows Java programmer to construct their own scheduler, that's not feasible here because this code which is the output of such a scheduler, you can't write it in Java. Most conventional languages don't have the notion of effect handlers.

SL: If you are compiling Java or Loom, you can define a control tag, then compile directly into this. If you don't need the full features of first class control, you can do just the things you need, say yield and fork.

FM: In Java, there is an interface which defines the set of operations the virtual threads can perform. That is the analog of the different labels you have for the resume. But a Java compiler just implements an interface via vtables. No way a Java compiler can take that interface and generates this code from it.

SL: depends, if an implementation of continuation in Java as in Loom, then you can change the backend to target this. If you write code that is completely unaware of this, then it can't.

FM: same is not true of shift/reset control/prompt style.

SL: they are the same, interdefinable

FM: with control/prompt, there are builtin functions, the rest is built on that

SL: no difference, you can implement shift/reset, control/prompt on top of this. If that's the abstraction on top, you can use this.

FM: My original question about why the design looks like this still stands.

SL: I tried to explain, we can come back to this.




FM: was this inspired by the mandate to not suspend in JS

AR: inspired by discussions that you have code you don't want to suspend because you want it to run to completion, or resources have to be handled in some way, JS is one instance. Other reasons like crossing runtime boundaries, something you want to enforce no suspensions.

FM: interface types is another example

AR: brute-force catch all handler that just traps. Can be more fine-grained you can write a handler, but only if you know the effects.

FM: In the case of JS, when dealing with JS promise integration, you have to build that in. Part of the reason is that we can't allow JS to suspend. If we rely on barrier instruction, we can achieve the effect of not suspending JS, it wouldn't capture the other part of the contract: it must not possible for Wasm to suspend JS.

AR: let's assume an example if you implement JS on top of Wasm. Whenever you enter Wasm from JS, wrap with a barrier.

AR: if you bake it into the semantics, how would you implement that semantics on top of Wasm, you need some sort of construct.

SL: it behaves like a catch-all handler doesn't mean it's implemented like that. It can be implemented by a system that doesn't do any stack switching at all.

AR: yea you probably implement it differently, a bit of every stack when you try to suspend, if it is set you trap. The barrier will set that bit on that current stack.

BT: threads scheduling loop is cooperative, to make it preemptive you have to compile code with checkpoints

SL: ideally you have interrupts, Wasm doesn't have that

PS: on Erlang side, under the cover is coop, from the user perspective is preemptive, because we compile code with checkpoint like function call barriers.

FM: you only need 1 way of interrupting with a clock or something

SL: orthogonal to underlying design

AR: usually green threads have check points that the compiler inserts, below the abstraction of source language, if you want to emulate actual threading on source level

FM: motivation is not just for efficiency, also for semantics, dynamic/static scoping

SL: there are other motivations yes, on next slide



FM: entire feature is an optimization, can do everything with asyncify

AR: not in pure wasm

FM: ayncify will do everything

AR: but not modular

SL: if we end up with recursive types, interesting to experiment to see if we can get performance improvements

RT: in that design you still linear scan to make it sound?

SL: that's an orthogonal issue

RT: you're still doing a linear stack search

SL: this has got the named handler, the problem with named handler is you have to do a linear scan if you're doing anything interesting. Also a design with direct switching without named handlers

FM: if you had a language with effect handlers, effect handlers are first class values

SL: not necessarily, for most implementations they are not, you can turn it into first class by wrapping in a function. Like a switch, or handle, or try-catch

RT: multi-core ocaml the root of stacks has table, with handler you can't do that anymore, you need to know the actual list

SL: abstract over it with a function. In multi-core ocaml is an extension of match.

RT: it has first class effects

SL: define a function that takes a thunk, then do a match on it. Pass that function around, isomorphic to the first class handler.

RT: have you implemented multicore ocaml on top of this. tried walked through that and ran into problems with this, particularly with optimizations. supposed foo event, with multiple handlers. Raise foo, search through meta info in stack, find stack that handles foo, switch to it, reduces cost when nested handlers. With first class effects, you switch to all stacks in the interim just to find handler for foo.

SL: initially this is more important as a design for existing weaker languages, we want to consider that, didn't understand the details of what you are describing, post offline? first class tags is one of the things listed on this slide, not sure if that addresses your concern.

RT: nope

SL: DL implemented a Wasm backend for Koka, he compiled it all the way, compiled to standard Wasm. He is also working on targeting this design, will stretch the expressiveness.
