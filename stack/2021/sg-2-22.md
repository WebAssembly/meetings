### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

RT: Why to Localize Non-Local Control. Slides: [(pdf)](presentations/2021-02-22-tate-why-to-localize-nonlocal-control.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-02-22-tate-why-to-localize-nonlocal-control.pptx)

RT: Dynamic enforcement: either suspend up to host frame automatically or trap on host frame. Either choice makes migration of code between host and Wasm difficult. Static enforcement: put an effect signature on each function. Most source has same signature. Adapter code handles effects not understood by embedder.

LI: The type signature looked similar as the effect handlers signatures earlier. Is this signature the same as the signatures in the multi-core OCaml paper?

RT: not sure the multicore ml paper had effect signatures. Daan’s work does. The one that you linked by Yizhou Zhang and Andrew Myers had explicitly effect signatures.

LI: explicit so you didn’t get confused, you didn’t mean to handle this effect…

RT: you're talking about lexically scoped effect handlers by Zhang and Myers
AR: You mentioned reasons effect signatures didn’t work in Java. Another reason is that you need polymorphism over effects for e.g. function pointers. Signatures won’t scale.

RT: worked through some concrete example like async/await, no need for effect polymorphism, you can have a concrete effect. For use cases that people have said they need, in earlier requirements document, this works.

LI: works with effect pass through? How would you declare the type that you would be allowed to pass through, without knowing the exact type. Is this called “row types”?

AR: one way to make it polymorphic, need some way of quantification over effects you don’t care or don't know about.

RT: Right, you need that when you have fine-grained effect systems. For our needs it looks like we just need a course-grained effect system.

SL: i’m a big fan of static effect type systems… wondering how much evidence we have that this is really necessary. None of this is implemented anyway. Will be good to know whether we do get performance problems if doing this dynamically, or we can take a conservative approach and always insert some sort of delimiter when making a call from the host into Wasm. You are certain this will have a performance hit, do we know this for sure?

FM: let’s pick up on this after Arjun’s discussion.

TODO(arjun guha): slides

DL: this looks like multi prong delimited control, restore is resume.

AG: even lazier than that, no multiple prong. No reason that we could not…

DL: good to be simple first

FM: How would you make the continuation ID unforgeable?

AG: you cannot do that here, because they are numbers, it would be difficult to pull off if you can store into linear memory.

AR: you’ll need reference types to achieve that

LI: similar to WASI using ints until we have unforgeables

AG: yes, this is just designed to fit into Wasm 1.0

AR: they probably can’t be cyclic, can’t create any cycle between continuations and other memories, some simple ref counting strategies should be sufficient to automatically handle memory and resources, you don’t need full GC. Is that the case in your semantic as well? Or can create cycles?

AG: I’m not familiar with this discussion. Talking about cycles between... ?

AR: do you need full GC? Or is ref counting enough? And that depends on whether cycles can form between continuations and other things in the engine

AG: We don’t use GC or reference counting.

AR: if you had references, then you could hide reference counting behind those, and engine can free them automatically. But that subtly depends on the property that you can’t form cycles between these things, i think is the case if you only have one-shot.

AG: if you have multi-shot continuations then things get significantly more complicated

DL: You cannot cross Rust/JS with a control operation?

AG: Right, you can neither capture this frame, probably obvious, but also can’t discard the Rust frame entire without returning to it. Some destructor that needs to run, forcing to return to Rust is essential.

AR: What happens if you suspend while a Rust frame is on the stack?

AG: rust frame on the stack, capture a continuation below, i get an id for the continuation, that refers to the delimiter up to in between rust and current frame. I can restore the continuation, which takes me to the delimiter, then returns control to Rust.

FM: How do you prevent using a token from earlier?

AG: there is a table that maps continuation ids to real continuation values under the hood, every time you push/pop, you push a fresh new table of continuation ids. The delimiter says that the continuation ids you have earlier are no longer in use.

FM: But there’s nothing to prevent me from using a previous ID?

AG: it’s a dynamic check, when you try to restore a continuation, we check if it’s valid. There is a set of continuation ids that are in scope, when you push a delimiter, the existing set goes out of scope.

AR: if you capture continuation and if you don’t know if there is an implicit delimiter in between, at that level it is an untyped language, in terms of higher level language compiled to that, you get a different continuation as expected. You can’t even detect that I think, how do you know you have a different continuation than expected.

AG: While compiling a high-level language to Wasm, it presumably generates calls to the host language... 

AR: the compiler might not know, might be something the module imports. Might have a native frame in the middle of calling the imports.

AG: I wonder if it is feasible to do modular compilation with the assumption that we have one module that uses high level control and another module which doesn’t use it at all

TL: as an example, in c toolchain for Wasm, when you compile an object file, a module with relocations, you don’t know if the undefined functions will be host functions or other wasm functions from another object file. You could mark that in source code and do something, explicitly put delimiters in.

AG: it’s a thorny issue. Implicit delimiter is not necessarily the right thing to do. In Racket, it’s a continuation barrier, blows up with an exception if you try to capture in an unsupported context, runtime error instead of weird behavior. The other option is static error, what RT proposes.

AR: that would be a third option, dynamic error is a right thing if there is a way to catch it, a trap in Wasm is not necessarily the right thing, you cannot catch them. Another option is that the operation that does the capture (control) has another failure continuation where it jumps to when it can’t capture. Then it’s notified it cannot do that and can handle it.

LW: It seems like you could turn it into the host’s version of an exception and propagate it normally, turning it back into the suspension above the glue code frame.

AG: that would be cool.

AR: that presumes you have some glue code, that’s the model on the Web, but not necessarily else where

LW: the code in the middle knows it is glue code, then it can be expected to do that (contract of being glue code), or it is not glue, or some other code that is linked, then it seems weird to be reentering and be expected to do that.

SL: current status of exception proposal? If we forget about continuations and think of it as raising exceptions, does it smoothly propagate through the Rust frame?

LW: if in JS we defined it it pops up as Wasm Exception, in Rust less clear. The exception basically carries an continuation inside of it.

SL: I’ve worked in a similar scenario, but the different frames might be on different machines. We had implicit barriers that prevented any effects or exceptions from crossing them, but also had a static effects system to guarantee that nothing went wrong.

AG: going back to LW’s original suggestion, it gets tricky to resume continuation. You want to resume, and need to reconstruct the stack top to bottom. It gets tricky to do.

SL: that’s where exceptions are much easier, there is no continuation to resume.

LW: If the rust code in the example, propogates by returning, it is taken the frame out of the stack. JS can return promises, JS can get itself out of the stack as it bubbles out.

AG: Is that what you want?

SL: need a mechanism for Rust JS to tidy itself up

RT: There’s also the issue that the removed Rust frame might have accepted and returned different types, so removing leaves an improperly typed call stack.

AG: we fudged it here by saying we only return ints, but it is more than just types. If the Rust code is doing useful work, chances are that there is useful work to do even on resumption. If on restore you take the Rust frame off entirely, you end up limited expressivity a little bit.

FM: Everyone’s been talking about foreign frames, but the same problem comes up when it’s another Wasm module, potentially from a different language. For example if the other module is compiled from C, which is not control-aware.

LW: It’s not an exception that needs to bubble up. Imagine the middle is just JS. When an uncaught suspension bubbles out, it pops out as a Promise since it hasn’t returned, it suspended. If you call an async function, it returns a Promise. I can return Promise up the stack, until it returns to outer wasm. If it has a particular promise, that suspends outer wasm until that promise resumes.

RT: But from JS perspective it calls a function that returns i32.

LW: Yes, then you just get a promise instead. 

FM: Wasm doesn’t know what a promise is, there is a type mismatch, Wasm function cannot return a promise at the moment, what is the type of a Wasm function that can suspend?

LI: How does the browser know that a function is async?

FM: we can discuss this next time, it is compiled to a function that returns a promise. You can’t use await outside of a function that is marked as async.

AR: that is a limitation of JS. If you have delimited continuations you don’t need that limitation. The question is how do the two mechanisms interact.

LW: ignore async await, think of it as sugar for Promise, and only think of Promise

AR: You will probably need to import some operations on Promises in order to work with them from Wasm.

LW: there could be a default thing that just works in JS API, what happens when effect bubbles out

RT: Oh you mean some sort of implicit conversion in the JS API.

LW: Yep.

AG: we are now getting into GC-ing continuations

LW: in browser, no problem, already have GC, just when embeder does not have GC

AR: Wasm makes a distinction between Wasm core and JS interaciton, completely separate document, this kind of things will not be in core, but will be in JS API. If that is sufficient, and LW’s idea of treating it as conversion, then we don’t worry about adding anything specific to Wasm

LI: I don’t know if this work for all types of effects, but in our Rust we got the Web executor from web-sys, and ... and if the promise dies, we call reject on the promise.gf

LW: a lot of different ways to interact with Promises, use externrefs

FM: anyone willing to sign up to give a presentation on this next time?

RT: on what?

FM: i don’t think my question has been addressed. If you call a function, you need to know if it can suspend, JS has a promise structure but it is not just JS involved here. Do we need to mark a function in a special type to reflect that it might suspend.

SL: isn’t that what RT was proposing.

FM: he was proposing that in terms of capturing foreign frame

SL: seems like the same mechanism. The mechanism that LW was describing sounds intriguing. If you can describe that to us more. LI’s mechanism was interesting, in terms of presentation.

LI: yea I did it in a talk, i can do that

LW: can make a sketch, but a little code out there

FM: LI and LW will present for next talk

SL: I still have my question about the performance consideration Ross was talking about, but I guess to answer those we would need to build and measure something.

FM: in the case of a C++ program using effects or continuations to implement async await, you are going to have a very deep stack between where you do await and where the thing is captured. It could be many hundreds of frames. Q for AG, in that scenario, what is the cost of doing a suspension.

AG: you think we will have a stack frame hundreds of frames.

FM: in C code, it doesn’t know async/await itself, using it to do asyncio, you’re deep in your application. You are making a synchronous call to i/o but converted to async i/o. Not a language which knows anything about async await.

AG: don’t have an answer to that, different kind of experient we can run. There is something simple we could do, we can take the safety checks and throw them out, and if doesn’t get faster, it tells you something.

SL: you also experimented with implementing async/await on top of C, C with handlers, have to tried an experiment along the lines of what FM was talking about.

DL: What I did with algebraic effects in C was capturing an entire callstack wholesale. Then it doesn’t matter how big the stack is except that you have to copy it. Since you know it’s just one contiguous piece of memory, it’s cheap to copy. If you can build in the write primitives, it shouldn’t matter how deep the stack is.

FM: we cannot allow host frames.. When we suspend we cannot capture any host frames, part of this discussion is how to prevent this, make sure you’re not capturing host frames.

DL: The host frames are related to linear resources. If you suspend, it’s good to know whether you will be resumed at most once, at least once, or exactly once. There may be resources that always need to be cleaned up once no matter what.
