## Meeting Notes

FM introduced the question of ‘whether the JS Promise integration’ is enough.
JS Promise integration allows traditional C++ sync code to work but does not convert that code into responsive code.

Meta: there was a lot of discussion about how to augment C++ to handle asynchronous code; but that was not the main point here.

LW: Suggested that posix threads would represent an opportunity for extended wasm to enhance C++ (along the lines of Virtual threads in Java Loom)

Gestalt: exposing stack switching through p-threads may be a useful opening for C++ applications in WebAssembly.
