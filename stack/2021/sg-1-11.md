## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

1. [Requirements for stack switching](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iDomt9mJdocJporD2PvsuOpjqemV_DyK8FRTK0QD9KY/edit?usp=sharing) (Francis McCabe) [35 mins]


<Discussion of whether iterator use case is critical>

RT: No requests for that functionality

TL: Any languages that could hypothetically take advantage of iterator support?

LI: Ruby.

RT: Many languages restrict generators to be implementable with state machines.

LI: Are Ruby and Python slow because of this missing functionality?

Consensus that this doesn’t qualify as a critical use case.

<Discussion of Async/Await>

RT/FM: Need to be able to await on Wasm from JS.

LI/TL: What about awaiting on JS from inside Wasm?

FM: That tight of an integration would over-constrain our design.

<General discussion>

FM: Is anything missing from this list of critical success factors?

LI: Do we need something for yielding to the event loop, even on engines that don’t have event loops? Do we want to be generic over all Wasm implementations? On the web you would return a JS Promise, but what about on embeddings without JS?

RT: You would be exporting an externref, so on the Web that would be a Promise and on non-Web embeddings this would be something else. So this seems like a library/import design problem.

LI: What if the asyncness is in the signature? Do we need a wrapping function or will the engine take care of that automatically?

FM: This is veering away from requirements and toward design.

RT: The underlying requirement here is portability of the design to different embedders.
