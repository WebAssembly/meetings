## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

1. Daan Leijen shares libmprompt link: https://github.com/koka-lang/libmprompt

2. Lightweight threads, actors, async/await, ..., in a minimal extension of the
WebAssembly reference interpreter (Sam Lindley)

TODO(Sam Lindley): add slides

Examples: https://github.com/effect-handlers/wasm-spec/tree/examples/proposals/effect-handlers/examples

FM: We’ve seen a few different styles of continuation structure so far. For example last time Daan shared a shift-reset-style approach. What’s the difference between that approach and this approach.

SL: Not much of a difference.

FM: This one has events, though.

SL: The multi-pronged control flow approach is an implementation strategy for implementing this universal kind of event that takes a continuation. The way people program with delimited control is exactly how people program with effect handlers (although Wasm is of course a target language) and any deviation from that makes programs hard to reason about.

DL: [on static-lwt.wast] missed this…

FM: Does this mean that when an event yields, the block will be exited?

SL: Yes, exactly.

LW: This is exactly like Wasm’s other control flow using blocks as labeled breaks.

FM: Normally a block has a block signature, i.e. arguments and returns. This one seems different?

SL: Note the ref $proc is also part of the results of the block, so it’s provided by the `resume` that jumps out of the block.

[looking at actor.wast]

SL: Looking at `apply`, it looks like some form of partial function application will be necessary for lifting functions back up to continuations. This might be a performance issue for implementations.

FM: Where does the resume with no labels go? How do the types work out?

SL: All events will be caught further up in the stack because no events are handled by that resume.

DL: There is the possibility that a resume will fail because the event is never handled. The types assume that there will be a handler.

FM: There has to be this dynamic matching of labels to events.

SL: Yes, just like for exceptions.

PS: In library code, you might have a scheduler and you don’t know what the continuations will return.

SL: Yes, you’d have to track the types around.

RT: What about dynamic event systems, where you have to inspect the events to figure out whether to handle them? In this system, it looks like there will need to be a stack switch per handler, even for handlers that don’t ultimately do anything.
