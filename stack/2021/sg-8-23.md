## Meeting Notes


### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

#### Stack Switching & V8 by Francis McCabe

FM: One motivation to share is that I’d like to encourage a second implementation as soon as possible.

SL: Why only desktop Linux? What about Mac as well?

FM: Mac more constrained, Windows even more so, in terms of memory

BT (chat): Are native (C/C++) frames stored inside stack segments?

FM: will come back to it, in short: probably. Thought about it, but not sure what the final result will be.

EI: re: arch specific registers, does that mean that currently V8 is targeting Intel's and ARM's way of doing it?

FM: yes

EI: see a similar issue with stdlib with rust, it uses a lot of stack space, actual erlang can use 4k stack, but when we hit dashmap, it blows up stack, so we have to keep our stack much larger.

FM: yea, if you have a million of these stacks, it's a lot of wasted memory

SL: are you envisioning deliberately forgetting stacks? We have that in Wasm typed continuations design (cont.throw). Distinguishing between forgetting on purpose or accidentally

FM: more concerned with accidentally - memory leaks

EI: how does that work with JS async await? are those globals?

FM: if you register with some IO event, it is effectively part of global, not actually, but conceptually

EI: any plans to allow stack size to be set when you jump to a new stack? In Erlang it's process memory size, both heap and stack. You pre-size it so you never hit a GC or allocate new segment. Do you think that will be opened up so that you won't hit perf cliffs? Say upfront how much space you need?

FM: thought about it, but can't see how this will work. If you have a Wasm instruction for forking a new computation, and has a number for estimated size, what are the units for it, what does it mean? In terms of actual instructions, can't see this happening. If there are hints in the custom section, then there can be a way of doing that, as an optional part.

EI: Won't work for our use-case. Users of Erlang/Elixir specify the size. Custom section won't work for us.

FM: can't see specifying this in a useful way without a lot of spec machinery. This will also be different on different platform. Strategy on Android device will be different from a big server. Hard to imagine a single piece of information being useful in all those scenarios.

BT: C/C++ frames in stack segments. If they are, then it is impossible to move the stack segments. You designed moving stack segments out.

FM: you still won't be able to move them, due to Control Flow Integrity

BT: that's unfortunate

EI: for Erlang, we can move frames, it's a single process memory, compacting GC, will be ok moving our frames in theory.

FM: if you have a return address or stack pointer or stack reference, you basically can't and be consistent with CFI. Pointer signing means that the value stored on the shadow stack is an entanglement of the current value of the stack pointer, and value you are storing. Relies on 64 bit memory have at least 8 bits that no one is using at the moment. The 64 bit value stored in memory, contains the pointer you want to store, and hash of the current value of stack pointer. If you move that value around, if you pick it up, the stack pointer will be different, the signing will fail.

SL: That will also be a problem in this Erlang setting, if you were concerned about CFI.

FM: if they put return addresses in stack. CFI is a new thing, new generation of hardware has it, most people have not enabled it. Chrome has or is about to enable it. In principle, we can say we are not supporting CFI, but you get a headline in some blog somewhere that says Wasm is insecure by design, which we don't want.

BT: you mentioned you'll need to resign some things

FM: if you go back to the stack overflow scenario, "Function Call Across Stacks" slide. We move spill from old stack to new stack as part of the special function call. One way to ameliorate the perf cliff is to not just move the most recent frame, but to move the previous frame as well. That would involve resigning the previous fp and contents of previous frame. If you have a stack overflow for a particular function call, it will only happen once.

BT: if you can resign by copying one frame, you can copy and move stacks, will require resigning all the return address.

FM: yes, that's possible, an option in our back pocket. Unknown unknown here. Don't know if we can do one frame, let alone all of them.

EI: how are you testing that stack switching works? are you making up instructions to test it?

FM: we are going ahead with JS API promise integration. That will exercise a lot of this, including the overflow. That plus unittests in various places. We can test a lot of this without adding anything to Wasm.

EI: re debugging, if one of you implementor open devtools, it will happen if it happens?

FM: it needs more resources than I can put on this project at the moment.

SL: any significant concerns about design you have considered and discarded

FM: virtual memory for stack management, that has been discarded. Were going down that road, but got feedback that we don't have much address space.

SL: that's even considering that you're initially focussing on Intel 64-bit Linux

FM: over the horizon but only just, we knew that we needed to do something for 32-bit arch, what changed for us was that we had to do this for 64-bit arch as well.

BT: do you know the fudge factor is?

FM: about 4k, unsure. Quite hard to find. Another design we looked at was switching to main stack for calls to imports. Getting that right would destroy our overall arch. may end up doing that, but getting details of it right was difficult. We felt that we didn't need to.
