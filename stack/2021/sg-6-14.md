## Meeting Notes

FM: this is dynamic scoping isn’t it? Of the effect labels

DH (chat): yes

KC: what do you mean?

FM: if the function itself has its own scheduler, a tree of coroutining, each level of the tree is another coroutining set. You rely on dynamically going up each level each time

KC: yes that’s right. In terms of matching on the effects, this is just like exceptions. If you handle the exception within the function, you handle it, if not it forward it to the outer scope

AR: just like with exceptions

FM: same problem as exceptions as well

KC: yes, think about restartable exceptions

FM: one of the effects of this is that it might slow down FFI calls, how much does it do that?

KC: we see 15% more retired instructions if you call into these c functions, compared to stock ocaml. These effects are hard to measure in terms of time. We can make C calls really fast, if the arguments are all in registers, we have the current stack pointer of the system stack offset in a global variable, we can load global variable, save rsp… There are fast paths here for non-allocating functions, because OCaml is a GC language, you might need to save state, if C function allocate and trigger a GC, if not we can optimize it.

FM: what about when calling OCaml from C?

KC: the separate fiber 2 and 3, we end up using the same space if we can, we don’t end up paying allocation cost for every time we do a callback. Callbacks are infrequent, calls to C are frequent. We have to make OCaml -> C faster, C -> OCaml takes 40% more instructions compare to stock ocaml

RT: what do you do about parallelism if there is 1 system stack?

KC: each of them have their own stack, no synchronization. One such structure and layout for each of the domains

RT: no shared state?

KC: yes, this doesn’t need any shared state

RT: in general, you can’t have a global var that stores the current c stack

KC: global variables are domain local variables, maintained in registers, points to a table of domain local variables, the C stack pointer is just and offset there

SL: previous meetings, work stealing schedulers came up, continuations need to move between domains, is that something you looked at?

KC: we just implemented a very fast work stealing, with support for blocking, in one of the multicore libraries. There is no affinity for the fibers to a particular domain, you can freely move them around

RT: the concern is, javascript references stored on fibers, then you can’t move them to other domains.

KC: yea we don’t have that same problem

RT: everything was in local cache?

KC: possibly. We ran this program 13 times, first 3 times was to warm up the allocator, then we measure the average of the rest of 10 mins. So yea I can believe that the program has everything in cache.

RT: if they are reading from memory, then they would be slower

RT: this is special case of bidirectional algebraic effects, anything more general?

KC: no. We have a way of saying to perform this exception… we haven’t come across a need for it (general)

FM: does that mean this example baz is incorrect? (Slide on Linearity)

KC: compiler will accept this code, but this is not code that we want you to write

SL: imagine a sophisticated linter that says this is bad code, or not very sophisticated in this case

FM: it is obvious because you have underscore

SL: you can look at the RHS that doesn’t use the continuation. If you have more intricate control flow it is harder

KC: common example is you enqueue it, then drop it on the floor. We played around with installing a finalizer on every captured continuation, we have GC, if you don’t resume it, we discontinue with an exception you cannot catch. It turns out to be 4x more expensive, the finalizer is too heavy for us. Using GC is not for fixing this. If you have a linear type system you won’;t have a problem.

AR: finalizer will make GC observable

KC: not a great idea, just wanted to see what the tradeoff was

RT: you mentioned efficient exceptions, when do you do bt for exceptions

KC: what do you mean? You want a backtrace for when the exception was raised? If backtraces are on, when you raise exception, when you go through a function, you build up the backtrace as you unwind the stack

RT: same as python, if you catch exception, move to a different spot, will you collect

KC: we have a separate primitive you can do that, raise and reraise, which allows you to continue building the backtrace from where you left off. This is useful when you have async/await, your thread throws an exception and propagate through await thread, otherwise you see a truncated backtrace.

RT: when you say throw, you don’t accumulate the entire trace at that moment?

KC: no, we build as we unwind

RT: special handling for tail resumptive?

KC: no, standard tail call optimization, we don’t run those functions, we always switch to the handlers, no fancy stuff. It doesn’t matter, if doing stack switching, you’re doing something interesting. If you suspend to do an I/O, which is what we care about, async I/o, generators, we don’t optmize fo that.

RT: majority of effects in Leijn stuff is tail resumptive

SL: if composing lots of effects together, underlying are not, the ones on top are tail resumptive

SL: what lessons can we translate to the Wasm stack switching design

KC: I am still in favor of an approach like libmprompt. Because we cannot move stacks around. 

Don’t anticipate supporting multi-shot continuations
