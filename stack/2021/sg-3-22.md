## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

FM: Can you explain why you don’t need color?

DL: Normally in C#/C++ you get a different type for functions that use async/await. The compiler transforms the function into a state-machine-like object. Need special primitives to compose them, like yield* in JS. In contrast, this work has no special types because it captures the stack up to the handler at run time rather than using a compiler transformation.

FM: For Wasm, the issue is that we are connected to JS. On the Web, we are required to not permit JS to coroutine.

DL: Yes, that would need something slightly different for interoperability. Question for Wasm, what is the right level this abstraction should be? At high level, there is effect handlers, there is lots of language design there, like masking, tail resumption stuff, finally handlers, etc. You can get a little lower, the #1359 proposal, the minimal resumable exceptions part of effect handlers, you can go even lower than that, multi prompt delimited control, used by the c library i have, it’s a low level interface. This is the primitive that does the magic, then put effect handlers on top of it quite easily. For Wasm, there might be something here that is the best, still needs discussion. Feel that this one is the lowest thing possible.

AG: there are lower level primitives, right, you can do ??? delimited control.

DL: if you go more down, you’re manipulating stacks and addresses and long jumps, those are also primitives, used to implement this at some point, my argument is that, that will be great to hide, for a portable abstraction. I imagine that Wasm will have abstraction at a higher level, and internally it will use multi-prompt delimited control. That will be an abstraction Wasm engines use internally.

RT: in your paper you talk about tail resumption, are you talking about that at all?

DL: not yet, maybe we can spend time at the end to talk about it more

RT: i bring it up because your paper shows 100x by optimizing for tail resumption

DL: yes, we have benchmarks that shows that, that will be an important part of an eventual Wasm proposal.

<Back to slides title “Multi-prompt is Well-Typed”>

SL: Do you know how multi-core OCaml avoids this hot-split problem?

KC: we use relocatable split stacks, you double the space and reallocate it, we can move our stacks, no pointers into it, don’t have that problem.

SL: if you don’t want hot splits, reallocate, but you need more space

RT: why does it require switch to stack

PS: ensure stack remains stable, keep the original c stack

RT: general case, what about for concrete case, like sin

DL: need to mark you functions, say some c functions are safe to call. Even with sin it is tricky, you need to know what size stack you want. E.g. if i am at the end of my stack, most functions have a prologue to check size of stack, but sin might not, so you need to check before calling it, otherwise will run out of space. Can be done, people go to lengths to do it. E.g. Haskell, you can mark c functions to be callable on green threads, before calling they will ensure there is a reasonable amount of stack space. Think it is solvable, but everything has drawbacks. If you have a GC, you might be okay that addresses are movable, but it also be not okay.

<Back to slides titled “Fragment Stacks(“fstacks”) (used by libhandler)”>

SL: the benchmarks you were doing, that was for counters, just implementing state, that’s not an example that you need to use an effect handler for

DL: It’s just overstressing the overhead of switching. Real async IO examples, for example, would be dominated by the IO overhead instead. Maybe for a tiny generator this would be more important.

PS: runtime has to switch between many different processes, the overhead has big impact on performance of program. It’s nice to know that performance of this is good.

SL: nice to have benchmark that is more in that spirit. You can even implement green threads here

LI: if we have an example, we can translate our test from lumen into this. Do we know why the Haskell one is fast?

DL: quite a fluke, there is also another library. It’s all monadic, compiler can fuse the handler, and removes overhead.

AG: C code is compelling, that’s how we get Wasm code now. If you can get that to work in emscripten, then can expose this to other compilers.

PS: part of the problem is without the low level primitive to save registers and switch, there is no way to implement it properly.

AG: yea ocne you get the lower level stuff in Wasm, you can build it

DL: i have to do magic in ASM to implement the interface

PS: what is the fastest way to get a wasm runtime with these primitives, to experiment. A lot of the presentations have been very informative, but we have to start an actual implementation in practice, how it integrates with JS. We will need an implementation in some runtime, maybe a playground. What are our thoughts on moving forward?

FM: on a lot of people’s minds, parallel tracks in this direction, we can cover in later discussions.

DL: hoping libmprompt can help with that. You can link your c program and you get these primitives, and can be used by wasm runtime to get it as it is.

LW: you can take c lib and link against the code you’re using to build lumen, and run it natively. And see what performance is. Wouldn’t be too far off from native engine.

PS: we essentially do something like this for native target. We know it works well for erlang programs. But for integrating with Web, esp JS, that gets interesting. We want to build for Wasm but with primitives here, so I can generate Wasm that uses these primitives, and see how it integrates with JS. A lot of the Wasm semantics we have to work, from JS it all looks like async code, not sure how that integration happens. Is that done by Wasm runtime? Or handled by of generating Wasm.
