### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

[RT presenting “JS API for suspending wasm on promises” [(pdf)](presentations/2021-06-28-tate-async-await-js-api.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2021-06-28-tate-async-await-js-api.pptx)]

RT: FM, LW, AZ and I have been meeting to discuss this.

[Slide: Understanding Usage Scenarios]

RT: AZ helped us understand classes of exports.

[Slide: Balancing Tradeoffs]

RT: LW introduced bindAsync while I introduced instantiateAsync.  They are on opposite ends of a spectrum.

[Slide: JS-Wasm Interchangeability]

SL: Going to show examples?
RT: Few slides after showing considerations.
SL: Concrete examples would help

[Slide: JS-wasm cross-call]

RT: Have to check if on the JS or separate stack
TL: Performance overhead on existing engines?
RT: We think not much overhead when checked with TM for V8.

[Slide: Example Usage]

RT: Wasm functions return i32 and doesn’t worry about Promises.

[There is an error in the code that uses parseFloat instead of the updated parseInt]

RT: Without suspender.returnPromiseOnSuspend, main would trap when called when it hits a JS Frame.
AG: Re-entrancy restrictions?  Can call main again?
RT: Can’t call main again.  Prevents re-entrancy. Forward-compatibility could allow it.
FM: To clarify main could not be called, but unwrapped exports could be called.
RT: Make a Suspender to wrap imports and exports.  The same Suspender can be used if multiple modules are using the same shadow stack.
FM: How does it solve the shadow stack alignment.
RT: It does not because we gave up on that guarantee.  You have to use Suspender right to maintain invariants.
LW: If you don’t wrap and try to call, it will trap.
RT: Right
LW: If you called an wrapped export it would fail, so you don’t need to worry.
RT: If called from JS it will fail.
SL: I have a basic question.  From a basic perspective from WASM, sync and async is the same.  This is only different from the JS side.
FM: That is the intention.
RT: We didn’t want to change wasm.
SL That seems fair.

[Slide: Semantics]

RT: Caller is Active state is a delimited continuation, but just calling it “caller” for now.

[Slide: susp.returnPromiseOnSuspend(func)(args)]

SL: Can I ask a quick question?  There can only be 1 caller?
RT: Yes, you’ll see that because there the state has to be inactive (no caller).
SL: Thanks.
RT: Conceptually step (3) is on a new stack, but it doesn’t need to be.
SL: Can you elaborate on how caller became caller prime?
RT: Suspender is stateful
FM: When the promise is resolved, the `then` is the microtask runner.
SL: So you carried on the chain father.

[susp.suspendOnReturnedPromise(func)(args)]
RT: (1) checks that on the suspender’s stack.  (2) Suspending allows for an immediate stack switch to function’s stack.  (3) is on whatever stack the function belongs to.  Step (5) frames are the delimited continuation.  Can do (6) without an inspection of the stack, but implementation requires change to current JS to WASM calls, so there is overhead. (7.A) is on microtask scheduler.  Conceptually in (7.B) the caller prime is the microtask scheduler.

[End of Slides]

TL: On the last line when it is thrown as an exception, is it as WASM exception or normal JS exception?
RT: For onRejected it is something called from JS, so it is JS value, so the JS Exception API.
TL: The coerced value will be an externref?
RT: Yeah
FM: This is the same as if JS called an exception to WASM.
TL: Thanks.  Wasn’t sure if that was the intention.
AG: Just to clarify the suspender object tracks a single caller.  The JS can callback into WASM?
RT: Where are you in the timeline.
AG: WASM calls async JS, which can call into WASM.  There’s a restriction that WASM can’t call a suspender.
RT: It can’t call the same suspender.
RT: It can call a different suspender.  You can chain 3 WASM modules together and change any to use this instead and wrap them with a new suspender that will do the appropriate stack switching and it will all behave the same.
AG: This suspender has this little state, but multiple suspenders at once?
RT: Forward-compatibility can make a new suspender on the fly.
SL: Don’t you have the ability to make new suspenders?
RT: The susp callee actually an argument to the function.
SL: Isn’t passing susp to an outer function equivalent.
RT: can’t go into it, but you can’t
AG: Can a ask related question?  Going back to code example. 

[Slide: Example Usage]

You’re running async code in JS.  Ah, I see you’re returning a promise, when the fetch returns you resume into WASM.  Can you effectively unwind the WASM stack?  Can you abort an inner WASM suspension?
RS: I can use the code to show why extension is needed for multi-suspension.
AG: Does anything enforce a stack discipline from JS?  There is a different example where you call another function in WASM that calls another async import that is using a different suspender object.  Does this API give a stack discipline?  Do you need to return in the inner suspender before the outer?
RT: There is something more advanced where nested suspenders are effectively suspended, but nothing is enforced as a hierarchy and the order can change.
SL: Maybe you illustrate the example to my question.
RT: asyncimp is used to figure out the baked in suspender.  There is no way to have a suspendOnReturnPromise where suspender is a call argument.  I don’t want to think of a way to make it dynamic on the fly during the call.
FM: It does not change the export/import signature of the WASM.  If you want to dynamic suspender, you need to change the import signature to pass in the suspender.
SL: What I suggested you could do with suspender as an argument, just when you call sORP, but you need a concrete suspender.
RT: For multi-suspension to work you need to compile differently for multiple shadow stacks.  When doing that you can thread suspender through.  Currently WASM programs have 1 shadow stack.
LW: To make it complete, the multi-suspension.  It is common to call async functions and not wait for one to finish like 5 fetches in-flight.
SL: You could have multiple versions of a function.
TL: Multiple versions of the same function or multiple instances of the same module.
LW: JS API allows multiple instances.
RT: Talked about suspender pools.  
SL: Presumably multiple implementations instead of hard-wiring one pool implementation.
RT: Have to ensure JS frames not suspendable. 
EI: Would you need multiple suspenders for the usecase of event callbacks while previous events are still being resolved?
LW: If you …
EI: There’s the processes running in the background on timers or other non-DOM events driving by requestAnimationFrame. Then there’s the form interaction callbacks. They launch a new [erlang] process and can return to JS using the rust-wasm bindings support for returning promises.
RT: Out of time; would be good to send email to see if this use case requires an extension or not.
