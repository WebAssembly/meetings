## Meeting Notes

SL: Typed continuations proposal
Implemented reference interpreter
Andreas/ Daniel/ Sam
Explainer written, planning to raise a PR
Various extensions
Currently trying to prototype in Wasmtime
I want to see Wasmtime prototype done. I want to see experiments.
Talking to Paul Schoenfelder

TM: Halfway through prototype implementation. Long tail of implementation.
Good chance of getting numbers
Competitive with asyncify

AZ: Not much to add. Tiny Go has shipped an implementation of go-routines using asyncify. 
Looking to seeing prototypes.
Implementation of go-routines was simpler/easier than doing it themselves in LLVM. Want to leave it to the tools.

BT: Attendance spotty.
Wizard is predicated on hardware protection for stacks. Looking for scaling to 100s to 1Ks.
Looking forward to a proposal that is complete enough so that I can try it out.
Would like millions of stacks in Wizard.
Virtual threads in Wizard?
Yes, and also real threads.

LH: I have a question. 
JS Promise integration in 2022 continue.

AK: Only occasional attendee. Fly on the wall. Most excited for prototype work. What are the riskiest aspects for multiple stacks. Tooling.

LW: I would add there is a lot of interplay with component. From a cross language perspective, we have been looking at an asynch API look like. A restricted form of effect signature. More limited than 1st class effects. Being prototyped in Rust tool chain.
Excited to see core proposal progress. Pthreads use case very interesting outside of the web because there is already a lot of parallelism; need to manage it.
Design constraints for interlanguage? Stop all effects at a boundary. 

SL: Do you feel that you have all the tools needed? 
LW: I know how to handle the cross language boundary.
The biggest constraint is the asymmetry inherent in the current proposal. You donâ€™t want the callee to not scramble the stack. You need the parent chain - this is important for cross component modularity. 
SL: Catch-all handler or barrier? Possibly re-perform effects. You may have security implementations
LW: The asynch design is friendly to structured concurrency

MK: Looking forward to progress on stack switching. Really needed for go-lang. The giant switch statement looks horrible.
Wasm is tightly integrated in the go-lang tool chain.
Hard to support multiple threads in go-lang.
A lot of special cases in the current code.
AZ: Asyncify can be used as a polyfill for stack switching.
LW: That is promising
MK: Have to look more into asyncify. Not sure what asynicfy actually does. Will catch up with you.

ID: I have not been talking much. Looking at it from a exception handling point of view. Looking forward to more results next year, especially wrt threads.
