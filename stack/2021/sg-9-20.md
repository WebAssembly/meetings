1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting

1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Discussions
   1. Typed continuations as the basis for stack switching. (Daniel Hillerström)

      I will provide an update on the progress of the typed continuations proposal. I will begin by recapping the gist of the proposal. Next, I will discuss some extensions that we have found to be important through experimentation. In the last part of the presentation, I will discuss some further extensions that I currently consider as "post-MVP"
   2. Next meeting [2 mins].
1. Closure

## Meeting Notes

DH: AR talked about this last year.

[Slide: Operational Interpretation, Continuations ~ Stacks]

DH: Activation frames are a(), b(), c(), … f().  Delimited continuations are described back in the 1960s. In Racket, call/cc uses delimited continuations even though call/cc is an example of non-delimited continuations.

[Slide: Delimited Continuations as Segmented Stacks]

DH: Pointers are from child to parent.  On suspend, the continuation becomes a structure back to the delimiter and the pointer flips direction, so the parent can point to the child stack segment as the continuation.

[Slide: Typed Continations at Glance]

DH: 

FM: When adding switchable stacks to V8 we assume garbage collection because we can’t guarantee it will be entered, which will cause a memory leak.

DH: We assume continuations must be invoked and not doing it is a programmer error.  I assume all implementations have GC underneath.

AR: The important bit is that reference counting is enough.

FM: Reference counting is not enough because you need to explicitly forget a count.

AR: No you don’t. The redline for full GC is you don’t have cycles, so counting is enough.

FM: Begs to differ on the GC front, but we’ll continue.

[SLide: Typed Continuations, the Idea]

DH: Think of suspend as sending data over a channel.

[Slide: Control Tags]

DH: tag from exception handling proposal. The result is new.  Cont.new takes a function reference and allocates a new stack that can run that function.  A key point is that the new stack is suspended.  Execution is still with the parent stack.

To start the parent stack,cont.resume, maps tags to handlers.  Handler is a basic wasm block.  Value stack needs trs and applies the continues to those trs, which returns t2s and then cont.resume returns those t2s.

Cont.throw injects a normal exception into the continuation.

RT: Some systems don’t need a separate cont.throw.
AR: You’d need something to inject the function call into the continuation.
FM: What is $ft in cont.throw? 
DH: That’s the function type.
AR: It needs to be t2.
FM: It doesn’t consume the continuation.  It will catch the exception in the continuation.
AR: These two instructions are dual to regular and exception running code.
FM: I have unanswered questions.

[Slide: Cont.resume, Operationally]

Cont.resume installs handler $hfoo.

[Slide: Cont.throw, Operationally]

Injects throw into continuation stack. Continuation can catch locally.

FM: We throw an exception into the continuation.  It could catch the acception and later do another suspend.  That means that what should be on the stack should be the same as a normal resume type wise.  The state of the stack needs to be the same whether resume or throw.

RT: How do you have the exception handler in the continuation suspends.

AR: cont.throw might need tag handlers

FM: It MUST have tag handlers

DH: It only might.
AR: Should you ever do that?  Cont.throw is only for abort.
DH: It’s not a flaw in the design.
FM: There’s still a gap.  You resume a continuation and it throws an exception.
AR: You can catch that with an exception handler.
RT: You can register an exception handler with the cont.resume.
FM: It is up to the application to decide.  It is normal for the continuation to throw an exception that is not to kill it.  If you have exceptions, then this is a normal pattern.
RT: This is bidirectional algebraic effects.
FM: Leave the cont.throw stack in the same state as cont.resume with a handler in place.
AR: Canonical extension is cont.throw to have a handler list.
RT: Another extension for bidirectional algebraic effects sends suspending events into the other continuation.
DH: I’m not aware of uses for that and so haven’t looked at it.
AR: You can always encode by dispatching at the resume point.
RT: There are primitives that exist to express this.
AR: But not first-order.
RT: They exist.
 
[Slide: Suspending Continuations]

FM: Go back a slide. I believe cont.suspend knows the final type of the computation.  In order to type check the suspend you need the final type.
DH: No.
AR: The type is the type of the hole on the child stack. Tp is upstack and tr is downstack.

[Cont.suspend does not guarantee O(1) transfer]

RS: Experimental evidence of stack depth of 1-2. 
DH: React and multicore OCaml.
AR: Linear in the number control abstractions.
FM: LW and I have discussed multiple levels if there are multiple modules running their own event loops then there could be cascading stacks.  If you’re deep in a module chain and it needs something from the browser event loop, then deep stack chains can occur.
DH: Each loop you’ll install a stack
FM: No, if you have lots of modules you have browser event loop and each cascaded event loop.  If you need something I/O then you need to go to the browser, that is a real world example.
RT: If async/await then there are long chains.
DH: There is only 1 handler.
FM: Depends on if I/O is virtualized.
RT: Did you analyze Racket?
DH: I have not looked at Racket.
RT: Why are we not interested in O(1) transfer?
DH: This gives modularity and composition.  If you need O(1) you need static dispatch.
AR: It doesn’t need to be linear.  There are other implementations.  Is there research in this?
DH: Dan Lyon’s work.
AR: It requires a global transformation.  Static transfer is compatible with this.
RT: You haven’t mentioned that the static one has abstraction properties.
AR: Actually other way around.
RT: Maybe I don’t understand what static means then.  There’s a paper showing that that approach and this doesn’t.

FM: When Mathew Flat (sp?) gave presentation on Chez Scheme, it is considered a part of the design for tail recursion resumption.
DH: No
FM: What does it mean to tail-resumptive resume?
DH: Tail resumptive can be inlined.  It is not possible to identify those clauses.
FM: OK.

[Slide; Control Barriers]

DH: Stop things crossing language boundaries.
FM: Wait.  This is new.  Is this similar to WASM/K?
DH: Yeah.
AR: It intercepts every tag and traps.

[Slide: Partial Continuation Application]

DH: Can get around not having cont.bind with code duplication.

[Slide: Extensions]

DH: This is asymmetric stack switching because you need to visit parent.  Symmetric would allow switching between siblings.

[Slide: Closing Remarks]

AR: GitHub repo goes into extension
FM: There are older languages like Simula67 that needs symmetric stack switching.
