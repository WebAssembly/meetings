## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
1. Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Discussions
   1. [Typed continuations as the basis for stack switching](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/stack/2021/presentations/2021-9-20-TypedContinuations.pdf).  (Daniel Hillerström)

      I will provide an update on the progress of the typed continuations proposal. I will begin by recapping the gist of the proposal. Next, I will discuss some extensions that we have found to be important through experimentation. In the last part of the presentation, I will discuss some further extensions that I currently consider as "post-MVP"

1. Closure

## Meeting Notes

DH: AR talked about this last year.

[Slide: Operational Interpretation, Continuations ~ Stacks]

DH: Activation frames are a(), b(), c(), … f().  Delimited continuations are described back in the 1960s. In Racket, call/cc uses delimited continuations even though call/cc is an example of non-delimited continuations.

[Slide: Delimited Continuations as Segmented Stacks]

DH: Pointers are from child to parent.  On suspend, the continuation becomes a structure back to the delimiter and the pointer flips direction, so the parent can point to the child stack segment as the continuation.

[Slide: Typed Continations at Glance]

DH: 

FM: When adding switchable stacks to V8 we assume garbage collection because we can’t guarantee it will be entered, which will cause a memory leak.

DH: We assume continuations must be invoked and not doing it is a programmer error.  I assume all implementations have GC underneath.

AR: The important bit is that reference counting is enough.

FM: Reference counting is not enough because you need to explicitly forget a count.

AR: No you don’t. The redline for full GC is you don’t have cycles, so counting is enough.

FM: Begs to differ on the GC front, but we’ll continue.

[SLide: Typed Continuations, the Idea]

DH: Think of suspend as sending data over a channel.

[Slide: Control Tags]

DH: tag from exception handling proposal. The result is new.  Cont.new takes a function reference and allocates a new stack that can run that function.  A key point is that the new stack is suspended.  Execution is still with the parent stack.

To start the parent stack,cont.resume, maps tags to handlers.  Handler is a basic wasm block.  Value stack needs trs and applies the continues to those trs, which returns t2s and then cont.resume returns those t2s.

Cont.throw injects a normal exception into the continuation.

RT: Some systems don’t need a separate cont.throw.
AR: You’d need something to inject the function call into the continuation.
FM: What is $ft in cont.throw? 
DH: That’s the function type.
AR: It needs to be t2.
FM: It doesn’t consume the continuation.  It will catch the exception in the continuation.
AR: These two instructions are dual to regular and exception running code.
FM: I have unanswered questions.

[Slide: Cont.resume, Operationally]

Cont.resume installs handler $hfoo.

[Slide: Cont.throw, Operationally]

Injects throw into continuation stack. Continuation can catch locally.

FM: We throw an exception into the continuation.  It could catch the acception and later do another suspend.  That means that what should be on the stack should be the same as a normal resume type wise.  The state of the stack needs to be the same whether resume or throw.

RT: How do you have the exception handler in the continuation suspends.

AR: cont.throw might need tag handlers

FM: It MUST have tag handlers

DH: It only might.
AR: Should you ever do that?  Cont.throw is only for abort.
DH: It’s not a flaw in the design.
FM: There’s still a gap.  You resume a continuation and it throws an exception.
AR: You can catch that with an exception handler.
RT: You can register an exception handler with the cont.resume.
FM: It is up to the application to decide.  It is normal for the continuation to throw an exception that is not to kill it.  If you have exceptions, then this is a normal pattern.
RT: This is bidirectional algebraic effects.
FM: Leave the cont.throw stack in the same state as cont.resume with a handler in place.
AR: Canonical extension is cont.throw to have a handler list.
RT: Another extension for bidirectional algebraic effects sends suspending events into the other continuation.
DH: I’m not aware of uses for that and so haven’t looked at it.
AR: You can always encode by dispatching at the resume point.
RT: There are primitives that exist to express this.
AR: But not first-order.
RT: They exist.
 
[Slide: Suspending Continuations]

FM: Go back a slide. I believe cont.suspend knows the final type of the computation.  In order to type check the suspend you need the final type.
DH: No.
AR: The type is the type of the hole on the child stack. Tp is upstack and tr is downstack.

[Cont.suspend does not guarantee O(1) transfer]

RS: Experimental evidence of stack depth of 1-2. 
DH: React and multicore OCaml.
AR: Linear in the number control abstractions.
FM: LW and I have discussed multiple levels if there are multiple modules running their own event loops then there could be cascading stacks.  If you’re deep in a module chain and it needs something from the browser event loop, then deep stack chains can occur.
DH: Each loop you’ll install a stack
FM: No, if you have lots of modules you have browser event loop and each cascaded event loop.  If you need something I/O then you need to go to the browser, that is a real world example.
RT: If async/await then there are long chains.
DH: There is only 1 handler.
FM: Depends on if I/O is virtualized.
RT: Did you analyze Racket?
DH: I have not looked at Racket.
RT: Why are we not interested in O(1) transfer?
DH: This gives modularity and composition.  If you need O(1) you need static dispatch.
AR: It doesn’t need to be linear.  There are other implementations.  Is there research in this?
DH: Dan Lyon’s work.
AR: It requires a global transformation.  Static transfer is compatible with this.
RT: You haven’t mentioned that the static one has abstraction properties.
AR: Actually other way around.
RT: Maybe I don’t understand what static means then.  There’s a paper showing that that approach and this doesn’t.

FM: When Mathew Flat (sp?) gave presentation on Chez Scheme, it is considered a part of the design for tail recursion resumption.
DH: No
FM: What does it mean to tail-resumptive resume?
DH: Tail resumptive can be inlined.  It is not possible to identify those clauses.
FM: OK.

[Slide; Control Barriers]

DH: Stop things crossing language boundaries.
FM: Wait.  This is new.  Is this similar to WASM/K?
DH: Yeah.
AR: It intercepts every tag and traps.

[Slide: Partial Continuation Application]

DH: Can get around not having cont.bind with code duplication.

[Slide: Extensions]

DH: This is asymmetric stack switching because you need to visit parent.  Symmetric would allow switching between siblings.

[Slide: Closing Remarks]

AR: GitHub repo goes into extension
FM: There are older languages like Simula67 that needs symmetric stack switching.
