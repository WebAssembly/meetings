## Meeting Notes

FM: JS API has a tight focus. Wants to be able to switch stacks without Wasm being aware of it because we’re not changing the Wasm spec at all. The API is also limited by the JS API conventions that are different from what we would want for Wasm.

We would like to have everyone’s blessing for this JS API approach. One option is to move it forward using the existing stack switching repo, or we can have a new proposal. The merit for a new proposal is that we could move quite a bit faster than the “main” stack switching proposal. OTOH, we might design ourselves into a corner if we ship the API before designing the “main” stack switching proposal.

SL: How has this forking gone in the past?

RT: One norm in my understanding is that when we have separate timelines for different aspects of a proposal, the tendency has been to split them.

FM: We’re not completely dumb, so this has been a consideration. The risk of the “hostage to fortune” scenario is limited, IMO.

RT: That’s why we want everyone reviewing this thoroughly to make sure there won’t be other problems in the future that we haven’t anticipated. Better to identify and work them out now than in the future.

AR: In the past the real problem has been that when we split out a proposal they have both been slow.

AL: (in chat) I see. I'd like to share my views/requirements for stack switching for TinyGo, but I'm not sure how that's normally done. I think I could make a short presentation for example for a meeting. But not sure where/how to propose this. (Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask).

All: Yes, this is an appropriate venue for that. Email Francis to set that up.

RT: Question for today is whether we want to ship a JS API first and whether we want to split into a separate proposal.

SL: There’s a more powerful version that lets you pass in the suspender as an argument, right?

RT: So far we don’t have a use case for that, but we know we are forward-compatible with that as an extension.

SL: It’s useful if you have multiple asynchronous calls in flight at once.

RT: Right. We know how to do that extension so if the use case comes up we can add it.

FM: To be clear, the scenario looks like this: you have a JS application that runs responses to your requests using WebAssembly threadlets. It’s not like running threads in your Wasm.

FM: Thoughts about whether to do a new proposal or not?

TL: If existing work and context will be useful in the future, then keep it an start a new repo. Otherwise just overwrite what’s already there.

FM: There has been work, but not really in the official repo, which is fairly empty.

SL: There has also been work on Andreas’s proposal, for example an interpreter implementation also outside the main repo.

RT: It would be good to see both proposals (JS API and Wasm changes) make progress at the same time.

AR: We usually have different repos for things we want to merge separately.

FM: We also want to keep the work separate to avoid trampling one on the other.

SL: Do you envision that we still discuss both in this meeting though?

FM: Yes.

RT: We also have to coordinate to maintain compatibility.

AR: We often have cases where we have to coordinate compatibility between proposals and it hasn’t been a problem. The two repos is mostly just logistics.

FM: Another option if we split repos is that depending on the final timing of everything, if we had a JS API repo, we could merge that into the other repo before the main Wasm spec if the timelines converge.

DS: +1 for a separate proposal to advance in parallel. Agree with AR’s points.

FM: Straw poll. Option 1: continue work as a separate branch within the stack switching proposal. Option 2: new proposal before the CG.

RT: Concretely, a phase 0 proposal.

No one prefers to keep using just one repo.

FM: Given scheduling constraints on the CG, we will probably be able to do this in late august.

DS: It doesn’t sound like this phase 1 proposal will take a long time. Probably just 5 minutes. I wouldn’t have any problem carving out 5 minutes from the August 3 meeting to get this going.

RT: I have a phase 0 writeup I can post today to head off any discussion that may arise.

FM: Any technical comments about the JS API besides the question SL raised earlier?

No comments.

FM: Personally I think it is very simple, and I like that. Am hoping to get a presentation from the Swift team in the future.
