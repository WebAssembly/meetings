## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

[SL sharing slides]

SL: I’m talking about this.  The extension that we proposed and implemented and a reference interpreter.  Trying out examples to see if this is practical.

The original issue is WebAssembly/design#1359.

Andreas made a formal spec at effect-handler/wasm-spec/blobk/master/porposals/continuations/Overview.md


Recap:
`event`: abstract commands/resumable exceptions
`suspend`
`cont.new`: function reference -> continuation type that does the stacklet creation.
`resume`: form of application that takes a continuation type and the expected arguments to run it.  Also installs event handlers.  Event handlers are the event type + label to jump to.
`resume_throw`: continuations are single-shot.  Can’t guarantee continuations are invoked, but if you need to tidy up the continuation.  The compiler is required to call `resume_throw` to clean up continuations.  Runs finalizers or language equivalents.  To be safe, guard every event handler with an exception handlers that calls `resume_throw`.

[SL showing “Encoding handles with blocks and labels” slide]

Uses `loop` with nested `block`s that maps event types to labels.  `resume` is the inner most call.  The label on the block refers to the code at the end of the block (This is how `block` labels work already.  Just a refresher for how `br` works in block to jump to the end.)  `block` are written in reverse of the order of the events.  The result type of each block is the arguments to the event and the continuation type last.

AR:
This is the similar to the encoding of a switch using `br_table`.

SL:
The end of each clause branch back to the loop.

FM:
How do you write the loop in a source language.  How to implement Loom where it allows the event loop being written in Java.

[SL showing lightweight thread example]

Events:
`yield`
`fork`

The interesting part is the implementation of various different schedulers:

Synchronous scheduler with loop with block for yield and fork.  Runs until dequeuing returns null.  Since this is a synchronous scheduler it does not yield at all.

FM:
We need to make sure the continuation is not re-enterable.

SL:
That is part of the design.  It will trap.

FM:
Another way to do this is linear or affine types.

SL:
That would be a big change to the type system.  Expecting compilers to guarantee linear code might be a bit much.   We’re doing the simplest thing you can do.  This is what Multicore OCaml does.

RS:
Does that not require a synchronization check on each stack switch.

SL:
That requires a null check.

RS:
Which could be shared.

AR:
Only if it is a shared reference.

SL:
YOu need to expose the continuation reference type.  With the current design, you need to check the continuation is not dead.

Anything else?

FM:
I’m OK.

SL:
`fork` takes a continuation and returns a continuation

What else I showed last time was instead an asynchronous scheduler.  On yield, run the next continuation.  Enqueue the new thread on fork.

[SL end of review of previously presented information]

RT:
Curious about parallelism.

SL:
What Loom does: if you have some event, you can give it different handlers - single thread or parallelism.

RT:
The issue is that I brought up before that it is possible to have stackswitching that doesn’t require synchronizaiton.

SL:
I have not thought of that deeply.

AR:
Shared state is very deep in WASM’s type system.  If continuations are not shared references, then you don’t need any synchronization.

TL: 
You can’t have a work-stealing system.

AR:
Can’t have work stealing without shared references.

RT:
The Linear version does have that.

SL:
The Linear approach is worth looking at.

[Back and forth occurs.  Sorry, couldn’t record while participating]

[SL shows actor example]


`self` gives mailbox
`spawn` creates a new mailbox

I was dependent on `func.bind`, but that creates a closure and that gives an unknown lifetime.  Added `cont.bind` to partially apply a continuation.  A continuation is expecting some arguments.  Partially apply to some arguments.  Does not suffer from lifetime problems because continuation is one-shot.

FM:
This might be a good time to talk about lifetimes in general.

We’re assuming it is up to the language runtime.

SL:
The backend of the compiler is disciplined enough to explicitly throw away a continuation it will not run.

If an exception is throw, resume_throw must be run.

Easier with linear type system or a static analysis.

`cont.bind` avoids code duplication.  If you have an event that returns an argument, you’ll have a continuation that expects arguments.  You’ll end up with code that needs to handle multiple arities continuations.  Using func.bind the arity is always the same.

Can `resume` be simplified to no arguments and have to fill arguments with `cont.bind`?

[SL shows the send 42 message through a chain of spawned actors]

The on_self handler gets a continuation that expects the mailbox.

There is a more problematic example with `receive`. Block the thread until the mailbox is non-empty.  If non-empty continue, else need to wait again if mailbox is empty.  Need to compose receive with the existing continuation.

If handlers can be composed actors can be written in terms of lightweight threads.


FM: put test inside the test not hte scheduler

SL: You don’t want to leak details, the thread is user code

FM: in user code you call library to receive message

SL: the interface to user code is just these things, no access that lets you see if there are any messages. You can have a design that does that, but not what is here.

FM: user code can’t directly suspend

SL: yea. Separations of concerns here, what is lower level, and what is going on here. Every case i come across, you can always work around this kind of thing. Maybe code gets more convoluted, or expose more lower level details.

FM: is this kind of pattern going to show up in other use cases?

SL: what use cases

FM: number 1 is async await

SL: what i’m about to go on to

FM: no actual i/o, have to resuspend immediately

[SL showing async/await example]

SL: I didn’t have any async behavior in the reference interpreter, so added some simple functions



async
await

Silly example is computing sum and putting it in a promise.  Async calls it three times and awaits and multiples results.

Interesting bit is the handler.  A very similar setup.

`$await-promise` itself import from “promise” “await”.  It only adds observers to list.  All work is done in `fulfill`.  If you await check for fulfilled.  If fulfilled give value otherwise store the continuation in the promise.  `fulfill` takes observers out of the promise and queue them.

[SL shows links. p12]

FM:
Settle work stealing.

SL:
Andreas, you said it depends on other things

AR:
That’s way in the future.

SL:
We want something to do the things we need to do now, but not rule out what will shoot us in the future later.

FM:
Other question: What a source language can do for itself.

SL:
Another question I want to raise: Concerned that these continuations get nulled, but you just keep generating more and the table keeps growing forever.  In practice that could be a problem.

AR:
You need memory management.

SL:
Array of continuations in space array

AR:
Just allocated in the engine.

SL:
What if they right to the same space again.

FM:
They’re not forgable.

AR:
It’s just a spec device.  Not observable.

RT:
For work stealing to be possible on the web it needs to contain no externref.

FM:
Need to unpack that too.  That was very helpful.

Thank you for going through that.
