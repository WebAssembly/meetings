Short Introduction to Go-lang (Michael Knyszek)

Defer statement (function scope) Defining

Pointers are explicit (like C) (Go is garbage collected which can cause complications)

Slices, bounded reference to underlying array

Built-in map type (hash map)

Function Values (aka closures)

Pointers are crucial to Go semantics

Interfaces (dynamic dispatch)

Goroutines

Go f(x,y,z)
Has its own scheduler
Each has its own stack
Beyond async/await
Lightweight threads

Goroutines communicate through channels

Two kinds of channel: unbuffered & buffered

Select over multiple channel operations
Default makes select non-blocking

SL: Why order of defer execution?
MK: Don’t really know. Feels more intuitive.
MP: Not aware of inspiration. Used for cleanup operations
SL: Well bracketing properties
SL: Can goroutines return a value
MK: Not really currently. Value is discarded.

MP: Go Language Features 

Defer: 
Can close over the return value (result)

Three implementations:
Heap Allocated, Stack Allocated, Open Coded

Compiler statically includes call to the deferred functions

RT: Deferes cant escape, why heap allocate
CM: Dynamic defer (as in array) requires heap allocation.

Panic: 
 Error handling done through return values
 Panic also there. Panics can be recovered from.
 Will execute defers.
 Panic recovery local to function
 Panic not used widely.
 E.g., HTTP server might use it at top-level
RT: Fault tolerant processing
SL: Very exceptional exceptions

MK: Standard Libraries such as JSON parser do use this.
RT: Exceptions (panics) must be handled by the same handler
CM: In gcc-go defer/panic handling handler by two-phase exception handling
ID: Seem similar to Common Lisp exceptions
RT: CL exception handlers don’t do any unwinding. Go is single phase; only during unwinding can you recover

MP: Implementation of scheduler

3 resources (G)oroutine/ (M)achine (thread)/ (P)rocessor (semaphore)

G explicitly blocks
G yields
G can be asynchronously preempted

P limits total amount of parallelism

Can block on system call - thread is blocked but P is ‘taken back’ to allow more G to run

Complicated to decide when to wake another M

Goroutines can share memory

RT: How important is work stealing
MP: Need to conserve amount of work being done. Dont support async preemption on all platforms. Work stealing more important on platforms that don’t support pre-emptive scheduling.
RT: restricted sharing across threads in WebAssembly

CM: Goroutine Stacks

Focus on ‘main implementation platform’

Start small (2kb)
Dynamically sized
May move 
Allocated from heap
Fixed size frame

Each OS thread has a system stack (g0)

Running scheduler, ffi calls,

Object allocation:
Object may be allocated on heap or stack
Stack allocated: escape analysis
Can pass stack allocated objects in functions

Goroutine switch
Preemption check at function entry
Yield voluntary
Asynch preemption by OS signal

Similar to setjmp/longjmp

RT: how important is stack allocation?
CM: important for performance
CM: taking stack addresses pretty important
CM: stack pointer is pretty important to Go.
CM: could cost 5x in performance

Stack growth
Stack bound check at every function entry
Allocate a new stack with doubled size

Segmented stacks are used on other implementations.

Stacks may shrink if small portion is used

GC may shrink during stack scanning

Stack Maps are metadata about live pointers on stack at safe points. 

GC scans stacks precisely if preempted at a safe point
Async preemption scans innermost frame conservatively
Metadata also knows about potentially live data

MK: Go Memory Management
GC language
Concurrent Mark Sweep Collector
One knob: CPU/Memory tradeoff
Goroutines may be asked to help GC

Write barrier enqueues pointers per P-buffer
Objects have no headers
Separate side-table

30% CPU utilization while running
25% as GC worker goroutines
5 user goroutine assist

Goal heap size (1+GOGC/100) *live
GC does not move objects
Interior pointers would make moving difficult

Maps can have pointer keys

RT: what about wide pointers
MK: Not that problematic; except for memory utilization.
RT: racy reasoning wrt wide pointers
MK: Go finalizers will let you revive an object

SL: stacks move?
CM: stacks do move. Means that we are more conservative about stack allocating objects.
