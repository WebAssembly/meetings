## Meeting Notes

RT presents an overview of effect handlers in multi-core OCAML

FM: When the stack parent is cleared, are the intermediate stack segments parent pointers kept?
RT: yes

FM: When you suspend and find that the ‘current handler dictionary’ does not have the right handler; you have to suspend again. How do you ensure that the original continuation is properly extended.

KC: In multi-core OCAML there is a special operator: reperform that packages up the current continuation and tries the parent handler.

SL: Why cant you compile ocaml handlers into separate tags?

RT: because handlers are first class in OCAML

AR: The original proposal had the equivalent of reperform and catchall but got dropped.

RT: starting to look at using first class stacks proposal

FM: Confused about stack.mount

RT: explains 

FM: What are the abuse patterns?

RT: If you don't have a stack type, or the wrong stack type then you can’t switch out of the current stack. You can use stack.mount to enable stack switching below the current point. 

SL: I’m afraid I didn’t really follow what the semantics of your proposed instructions is intended to be. Have you written up the specification somewhere?

RT: Just a sketch.

RT: Design sketch is [written up](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/issues/5).
