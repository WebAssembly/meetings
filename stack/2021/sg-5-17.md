MF presenting

[Slides](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/stack/2021/presentations/2021-5-17-flatt-racket-intermediate-language-control.pdf)

SL: looks like a lot of things, could you cut it down to a few call primitives if needed?

MF: that’s what we will be doing, as Wasm designer you won’t want to add 30 things

AR: since you have all these boxes, some needs to hide from lower levels, does that mean some of those layers are not really safe?

MF: A good example is continuations, at the racket level all continuations are delimited, we can’t provide the raw scheme at the chez level, exposing them in the higher level would not be safe, each wrapper is building up stoff that need to hide/refine at the higher level

AR: they are too powerful.

RT: what does unsafe at the upper level mean?

MF: if you had chez scheme call/cc at racket layer, you can capture too much, can ignore delimited prompts, unsafe in the sense that you step outside where the semantics say happens, when delimiting doesn’t work

RT: unsafe from how racket language is supposed to interact, but not in the view of memory safety etc.

MF: unsafety as unspecified behavior, capturing undelimited continuation is unspecified behavior

FM: what happens when you finish evaluating e1

MF: So when we have a value v1, it will get delivered to the next bubble, and the badge goes away along with the square box

RT: seems like you want that for other reasons

MF: calling continuation is more convenient in a lot of contexts

Amirouche: does racket have parameters?

MF: Yes, they are implemented with a mark

Amirouche: Marks are like thread locals?

MF: It is a continuation local and not a thread local - if you try to use the same continuation in two threads bad things can happen 

DL: all the v values cannot be updated in place, you cannot set v to a new value

MF: Yes, racket is not purely functional so the box could be a value that you mutate

DL: if you do the continuation multiple times...

MF: Will come to that in a minute

FM: are these tags first class values?

MF: In racket they are first class values

FM: how important are marks?

MF: We use marks for parameters, something like current directory, used in the contract system, don’t have a list of uses right now, but there are 6-8 of them  - enough that we built them into the chez scheme for performance

LI: if something similar like this was used to implement erlang processes, equivalent thing would be process dictionary. Can see similar use in Erlang for it

FM: If you go back one slide, you may not know who to go back to, you may not know where your delimiter is, can you put the delimiter in a mark?

MF: you can do that, delimiter tags are values, marks can be arbitrary values, that is one way to implement certain things, you can have a private key that corresponds to prompt, and find prompt that way. We don’t actually do it that way, delimiting is more fundamental. The machinery in some layers is similar.

FM: at the moment we are not looking at building the equivalent of marks, although some of us would like to, right now we’re not

DL: Coming from algebraic effect language, you could implement the marks in a non-primitive way, using prompts - that inserts and gets in a key-value way?

MF: or you don’t need prompts, you can do marks with raw chez scheme with state on the side. That’s one unsatisfying thing in the zoo in racket, more than one way

DL: I wanted to verify, it is possible? Partly the way chez scheme works,important for wasm to figure out which primitives are truly enough, you may have enough without marks as well

MF: question of which combination performs right. Food for thought, one way of stacking them up

LW: Is the main thing you’re optimizing for performance? Are there other factors?

MF: believe that’s right, want to make sure it has a certain level of expressiveness, and make it go faster

RT: These are largely a concern for multi shot continuations?

MF: Yes

RT: Still useful, wanted to clarify

BT: you end up making copies of every frame, you copy at least once...

MF: That’s right

BT: Stack segments are garbage collected? Are they in a special region?

MF: the stack is in a region special to GC in that it makes it able to do the splitting. Two pointers so you can get the total size of the segments

BT: They also need to be in the right order so you can use them in a native execution stack?

MF: when i hit underflow, it can be a completely different part of the memory

BT: do they need to be next to each other for any reason?

MF: the things i drew, the GC might move them in between, interesting subtlety there about one-shot continuation, can come back another time.

LI: A concern for FM is that V8 is CFI, can this do CFI on intel stacks?

MF: think not, not using the C-stack or the usual registers to refer to stack, just doing its own thing, things in heap.

LI: You used register, wasn’t sure it meant a cpu register or a virtual register

MF: virtual register, may or may not be CPU register. Depends on the CPU, not on x86, yes on ARM.


FM: If you’re not using call/return instructions, does that affect performance?

MF: no, there was an era in 2000s or so, it was a big deal for branch predictor, found that to be tru ein Racket JIT, these days it doesn’t seem to matter. Jon and students had paper on PLDI noted small effect, just because processors have evolved, not sure if CFI changes things.

LI: Would be really cool if we can get a hardware perspective

MF: haven’t measured on arm

BT: specific hardware mechanism for call return on hardware cpu, probably indirect branch prediction has gotten very good, may depend on how many indirect branch. It will normally prefer to use return stack buffer, if stacks aren’t too big.

MF: When stacks get big, it gets harder to come up with benchmarks

FM: I get the impression that on x64, there is more optimziation going on in call/return for call stack, for e.g. push push pop pop faster than exchange register, which it shouldn’t be, but it is.

LI: IS that maybe a fusion, when it’s translated to microcode?

FM: having a hardware expert on this panel will be great, to answer questions like this

LI: worried if they will tell us, is that too secret

FM: We  can give them the opportunity to say that

BT: usually specific guidance about fusian in Intel manuals, changes often, you have to read the manual in detail, it’s not secret

AR: what does racket typically use multi-shot for?

MF: Threads, the cooperative at the runtime level, preemptive at the racket level

SL: those examples are all one-shot, i would imagine

MF: correct, interestently wasn’t able to get any performance improvements for threads.. For many reasons. Opportunistic oneshots are a slightly different flavor

DL: it might be that you already paid upfront, if you look at it again, you can make call1/cc faster.

MF: One of the things happening - callcc was keeping larger stack segments around - the live portion of the thread was so small, maybe you’re right?

DL: might be in practice it doesn’t
MF: This opportunistic one did pay off, but it was tied with continuation marks

RT: if you knew the continuation was one-shot for with-mark, would you have to write the frame at all?

MF: Lots of things you can do to avoid creating frame, similar things happen with marks - if they are low enough you can do different things with the compiler .. explains with ‘+’ example. We change the way tailcalls compile in certain ways.. The compiler can know how with-marks work

DL: a cool thing if you wanted deterministic reproducibility of proofs, get away from timers, use number of instructions executed, even with threading you get the same results, even if computer was faster or slower

MF: Yes, when I say timer, it’s not a cpu timer - it is counting how many times you pull effectively. Interesting tradeoff - when you have foreign function interactions etc. always thought we may have to switch back to wall clock, but the decrementing counter has been effective so far

DL: also for things like fuel, for continuations you can cut something short, it’s a powerful concept

RT: With Racket’s amcro system, can you take continuation marks and compile them to use primitives (?)



MF: I left out the slides where we did that at first, it worked alright, ran for a couple of years, when moving continuation marks more primitively, 20% boost on continuation heavy programs, contract-heavy programs. It was worth the extra 20%. I hesitated a bit when you talk about macros, the layers and boxes aren’t quite macro expressible. One of the first things we tried to build things on top of Chez, worked well enough to get going.


RT: How do you do debugging? Do you use continuation marks?

MF: if you use Racket, provides a predictable debugging experience, doesn’t optimize away things, constrained that way, preprocessed to add with-marks all over the place for debugger to look at. If you don’t use that, you get a raw virtual machine stack.


RT: Especially if you want certain semantics

MF: that’s where continuation marks, the stepper for DrRacket, to reconstruct programs to effectively debug them

AR: Always impressed how scheme decomposes all of the things, added complexity in wasm is that we don’t want to depend on Gc, but also don’t have closures - hard problem, but any ideas on what we could do?

MF: great question, don’t know the answer to, happy to let people work on it, thought about how to compile Racket to Wasm. Hard to imagine Wasm garbage collection that will let Racket do the stack splitting thing, as we talk about knowing the stack layouts, splitting by just moving a pointer. Generally, don’t know how to abstract over garbage collection. Control things are very much connected to garbage collector.
