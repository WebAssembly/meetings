### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

#### Multi-Stack Requirements by Francis McCabe

FM: thing that strikes me the most is 3rd use case, yield-style generator. Would like to see a more convincing critical use case. Not sure what it is.

PS: specifically for generators or green threads in general?

FM: this was a stand-in for other forms of non-local control flow, we have green threads already as a critical use case

PS: you mean continuations or things of that nature? call/cc or variants. Call/cc is a technology, not a use case

PS: a use case can be supporting languages with control flow structures natively like that. How are you going to compile to Wasm without support for control flow that is based on continuations.

SL: we felt that those kind of things are not critical use cases, there are such languages…

PS: what is the definition of critical use case? In my mind, we don’t want to restrict such languages from being able to target Wasm

SL: yea maybe that’s reasonable and we are too conservative. Supporting Scheme might not be a critical use case

PS: perhaps that isn’t, saying if we can’t support the way Scheme does continuations, which is critical to people who want to bring Scheme to browser, but not critical to others. If critical is about top 10 programming languages, and not anything else, that’s one definition of critical.

FM: lead to adoption

RT: critical to the proposal being successful, being adopted in Wasm

SL: use case and critical success factors seem to be different things

FM: critical success factors is something we must satisfy, a use case it what we are targeting

SL: difficulty in identifying the exact scope of green threads, does that encompass coroutines? Actors? Promises? Depends on what taxonomy you want to use. All of those things are important, how you group them is arbitrary.

FM: one reason I left yield-style generators in the list was, there is a risk of going down a particular technology rabbit hole that was too focused on async-await and green threads, whereas the other use cases don’t seem to come up to the same level, but don’t necessarily want to leave them out. Async/await wait up in the front, everybody needs it, green threads needed by a lot of people, the other things form a long tail.

RT: the top 2 are really critical use cases for the MVP, but you want a viable path towards the tail use cases (yield-style generator) so at least we have thought about them

FM: this list doesn’t talk about MVP at all, but yes that is a way of thinking about it. Want to make sure we don’t cut off the long tail.

SL: in the long run, the long tail does support for general continuations like in Scheme

PS: support for async/await green threads, can’t imagine you can’t implement generators on top of them

FM: that was the thinking, maybe rather than talking about yield-style generators, we should talk about long-tail uses of continuations, much harder to enumerate that long tail

SL: there are many many examples, a big one is reactive programming, which is kind of tied in with green threads

FM: will take an AI to edit this slightly







#### Should we add 'work stealing' (aka moving tasks between threads) as a requirement?

RT: from discussions, i got a sense we want to reconsider work stealing in scope. Teams are coming in with plans for goroutines, there is an implicit assumption that goroutine can be moved to a different thread, number of languages are assuming that. Conversations with people from TC39, discussing how JS moves to support more thread centric parallelism. Web workers are very isolated, ongoing proposals that web workers can share mutable state and make effort to ensure that mutable state is well behaved, so engines can still perform optimizations. E.g. looking at explicit distinct heaps, can move an entire heap from one thread to another, or share heap but read only view. Also looking at sharing certain JS objects with fixed prototypes, shape cannot change, all shape analysis can still work in parallel settings. Looks like JS will have a richer support for parallelism, in this proposal we are thinking of moving from one process level thread to another. Constraints that come up are the JS setting constraints, if your stack has JS references on it, you can’t move it to another thread, would break many engine optimizations. What are the implications of supporting work stealing?

FM: work stealing approach to parallelism underlies the Java story and Swift story. A number of languages moving to this model of many tasks distributed over smaller number of threads

RT: and Go too. Erlang probably hoping for this too? (stacks move across threads)

PS: absolutely, key part of how Erlang scheduler works. If we can’t do that, it is an acceptable loss, but is a key optimization lost. Browser remains to be seen, that will largely depend on what kind of workloads are happening in the browser. We might be be able to do dom-less rendering then pass to main thread. In non-browser land, work stealin gis critical

AR: is it realistic to talk about this before we have pure Wasm threads?

PS: much less interested until there is notion of real threads. We have been treating Wasm as single threaded in our compiler

SL: our current spec (inspired by multicore ocaml), any reason why it can’t be extended to support work stealing once we have threads. One of their example is a work stealing scheduler

RT: you need to guarantee your stack doesn’t have JS refs on them

SL: the subtle thing here is interaction with JS

AR: OCaml has similar problems, they multiplex syscalls to one given thread, the env can’t just do anything on any random thread. There is one kind of thread that is special, is more capable than the random threads you spawn. Don’t think this problem is specific to JS

SL: more about interactin with external system

LW: in the future when Wasm has threads, we talked about shared fn and shared types, shared fn can called from any thread, so transitively the types can be accessed anywhere. For continuation, you have a shared continuation, suspended from shared fn, will prevent unshared reference in stack

AR: exactly what i would expect, have to work through the details of transistive, only make sense after we have shared attributed

LW: Wasm will need a fork instruction, if we add a shared attritube it can be postmessage-able. What does it mean to add shared, with transitive property, does it guarantee …

RT: implications of interop constraints with JS or external system. One issue is when shared fn call non-shared fn, with guarantee that non-shared fn won’t suspend. In a disjoint heap model, with message passing from one heap to another, some fn that is called by send operator, takes care of copying, move data from its heap to a format that is allowed to be on another heap. This special fn can talk about two heaps at once, do the copy then the suspension happens

SL (chat): If anyone's interested, there's a Multicore OCaml implementation of workstealing using effect handlers here: http://www.lpw25.net/talks/meetup2015/multicore.tar.gz

SL: an overview of current status of threads proposal?

AR: current proposal is limited, implemented in most engines. Really only adds atomic instructions, and a memory model. No notion of ways of creating a threads from within Wasm. You can only share memory between threads (Web workers from outside).

SL: would it make sense to share a continuation

AR: the paper for memory model, an extension that is a bit richer, includes refs and functions, type system has shared attribute with transitive guarantee, shared cannot point to unshared. RT says might be too weak in some cases. It’s quite far in the future, discussing quite hypothetical thing. Continuations are another ref type, they also have this shared attribute, will be how they fit in. Question is the typing rule, can try to work through that.

SL: what stage is threads proposal at?

AR: technically stage 2, thing that keeps it at stage 2 is that test infra cannot yet handle that. It’s there now, so we need to port that. We need to edit the spec, include what we did in paper. Process side is lagging behind, implementation is there. Spectre thing stalled shipping implementations. This is a very limited form of threading where you can only share memory, all these things are not expressible there. No concrete work on follow-up.

SL: wonder if we should try implementing concrete example in ref interp that combines thread with typed continuations proposal. Would that necessitate adding extensions to these sharing properties

AR: can try playing, question is how far you have to diverge implementing this sharedness type system, maybe not that much work

SL: RT, do you have concrete examples of something going wrong?

RT: the example of message passing, you need a way to temporarily to talk about 2 disjoint heaps in a setting where I’m guaranteed not to suspend. In a shared function, but need to call out to a non-shared function, with some guarantees that you won’t suspend while doing so. High-level constraint for the proposal is, if we want to support work-stealing eventually, what path do we have to making sure that the stack frame has only sharable things, without walking and examining everything. Maybe the straightforward thing of shared is enough, or not.

FM: the idea of calling a non-shared fn from shared fn strikes me as problematic, have to be a different way. In Interface Type, we resolve that by adopting multi-memory as a requirement. Still hasn’t been fully adopted. If we have the equivalent of that for gc memory, you can implement message passing.

RT: a lot of stuff we take for granted that needs to be supported within Wasm, how to support them without building in everybody’s mechanism (e.g. message passing)

LW: default assumption is to use shared memory to implementing unshared memory for message passing. Think this is an orthogonal discussion of how do we do shared.

FM: not a regular data structures

LW: this continuation and all stack frames do not contain refs. That can be orthogonalized from how we do fancy sharing, where we temporarily rendezvous

SL: once wasm supports threads and stack switching, it should support sharing of stacks. Wll be disappoint if Erlang cannot leverage this

RT: currently that will be the case with either proposals we have written

LW: the fork primitive, which starts a new stack, the root being Wasm, so it doesn’t involve JS

RT: with fork, the new fork thread can call out to JS or call import

LW: it won’t be able to take any JS, it is off of the JS thread, won’t make sense to be able to call JS

PS: this is a restriction we can live with

LW: certain WebIDL defined as shared, can be taken off the main thread, not JS unless JS can share functions

RT: shareable suspension can only be handled in shared functions… we should spend some effort thinking through that
