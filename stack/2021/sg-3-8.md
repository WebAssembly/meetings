## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

LW Presenting [Notes]

?? Confirms that JS engines will not want to allow JS off the main stack.

...

FM: What if Wasm calls a JS import, which calls a Wasm function?

LW: That is reasonable.

LH: We could also copy in and out of a possibly dedicated stack area to avoid switching stacks.

FM: Copying the stack will be incompatible with CFI.

LW/LH: We still want copying to be a feasible implementation strategy.

... Low level API 

AR: Is the JS suspendCaller the same as the suspend instruction?

LW: Semantically the same as throwing an exception up to JS-Wasm boundary, where a suspend occurs.

RT: But all the JS frames up to the next Wasm are lost.

LH: better name is throw to Wasm on suspend

LW: weird function, but is essential

RT: also you’re requiring the results of event line up with results of function, anyone who wants to be suspendable, it has to overlap two paths (return and suspend) and the signatures have to match. You can’t get an int from JS for example, unless you suspend an int.

LW: when JS want to suspend its Wasm caller. This is not happening n-deep. This is JS glue code that is specifically implementing async Wasm call.

RT: for most other settings, when you call into a function, which might suspend, the normal return type can be different from suspending type.

LW: Because JS is different and this is glue code, don’t think we need that flexibility. This is intrinsically tied to Wasm suspensions.

AR: Assumes immediate caller of yourself is Wasm

SL: will you show a high level example of handling await promise in Wasm?

LW: nope. I have a slide describing an interesting case where the low-level API can do but high-level API cannot.

... High level API

FM: What happens with re-entrant code?

LW: implied loop that happens that keeps calling the continuation, same way as original code did.

AZ: does this assume when Wasm call JS, that JS will return a promise.

LW: This WebAssembly.await takes a promise.

FM: looks like foreign frame scenario, capturing foreign frames. This would allow Wasm library to implement coroutining for JS. We can’t permit Wasm to surreptitiously implement.

AR: If I understood Luke correctly, you would have to do the capture manually rather than having it happen magically.

LW: you’re basically building up a whole chain of promises, propagating inner continuation to outer one

RT: all functions are async

AR: all have to aware of this pattern, and cooperate

LW: there is a higher-level ABI that they all have to follow. The JS in between has to know and follow continuation ABI

RT: sounds like Arjun’s stopify js to js compiler

SL: very similar to what we do in Links, treating JS as a target language rather than what you want to program by hand. Seems inevitable that if you want to support something like this you have to do something horrible. Aligns with what FM is saying, impossible to do it in a pretty way.

TL: AZ, we haven’t observed that interleaved frames have been very important

AZ: yea, not important, but doesn’t mean don’t exist

TL: worry for asyncify, even though not observed in practice, in principal, someone could write arbitrary JS code. We get a chance to process that in Emscripten, not sure if we can programmatically and generally transform that into this interleaving ABI.

RT: it’s a tool that does that, possible with restriction

TL: either way, not high priority for emscripten use case, not observed in practice

FM: i think we have to prevent it. We will not get past the TAG if Wasm allows JS to be coroutining, without the promise.

RT: it only works if all the code was already set up using async/await, not automatically making it coroutining. Coroutining JS can be hooked into this

LW: if JS is unaware, dynamic error

FM: for 4-tuple, what happens if JS returns a 4-tuple.

LW: The 4-tuple only pops out if you use callSuspendable. You know whether you have results based on whether you have the results field.

... End

RT: higher level API is similar to Alon’s previous proposal.

LW: I guess the difference is that I moved the suspend from inside Wasm to outside.

AZ: …

LW: …

AZ: Statically knowing the sites for asynchrony sounds fine, so I wouldn’t object to the medium or high level APIs.

AR: in JS you have to know, defining an async function there, seems similar

RT: LW and I talked about this, a component, make everything async without changing inside. Run it on a different host stack.

LW: The wasm.wat is a synchronous code.

ID: This needs to interface with the current EH proposal. Would that work as-is?

LW: seems like they would go well together. The EH proposal has been preemptively framed to compose well with events. Similar things in Wasm.event, exceptions will have a similar thing, if not exact.

ID: AR has something with delimited continuations with resume, is it similar to extension of EH with events.

LW: maybe not exactly that, but something like that is standardized for core wasm. This is what the JS API can do to account for that and do the suspending itself.

LI Presenting (TODO:slides)

TL: what do you do instead of using Wasm stack?

LI: only for Wasm target, we have a stack frame of (not wasm stack) what to call and args. We don’t know if we need to GC or run out of time. When you exit, scheduler tries to put it on the actual stack. The queue is the side data structure, not the actual Wasm stack, just a vec in Rust. That’s so we can yield partway through, we don’t have to ensure stuff is reentrant when we hit GC.

FM: Is this analogous to the cpp shadow stack?

LI: probably. The stack per process on Wasm is a single thing in memory called the heap, same as x86, stack and heap on opposite end towards each other, GC triggered when they collide.

FM: sounds like prolog.

LI: erlang was first implement in prolog, now it’s in C. Lumen is in rust.

SL: what about the GC.

LI: GC written in Rust. We couldn’t port the Beam code to Wasm, it does POSIX vm instructions, it uses 2 gigs of mem but doesn’t commit so it is fine. We use what BEAM calls supercarriers. Process only grows at certain intervals, more block-based. The tricks of page-marking and not allocating, we can’t use. It’s a copying-compacting collector. This is me doing by hand. With stack switching we hope that we don’t have to do the shadow. The way I did that was that everything is on shadow stack, it’s slower than it should be, but not terrible, 64k processes, not that bad compared to native speeds, but can be better.

RT: if you take the higher version of LW’s thing, stack per instance. You need more than 1 stack per instance, you can do something similar, everytime it yields, it gives you a stack, when you call async into Wasm, you can specify which of its stack to use, or use a new stack. Wasm module is a black box, but JS API gives you the structure.

LI: The way the x86 code is generated, there’s a check at every function to see whether the reduction limit has been reached. If the limit is reached, the process is swapped out, but the scheduler might swap it out anyway. The scheduler in WebAssembly needs to have multiple stacks and be able to switch between them itself. If this was driven from JS, we would only call one process per frame (60/s) this is too slow.
