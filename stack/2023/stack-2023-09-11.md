### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion


Raw Chat log (log is truncated, unfortunately):


tlively:
"As low level as possible, but no lower"

Benjamin Titzer:
I found that NANDScript was maybe too low? 
Thinking more in the background, could this proposal be loosened so that you can only switch to a suspended stack (not a moribund or running one)?
Ross Tate:
That’s already its semantics; if you try to switch to a non-suspended stack, you trap.
Benjamin Titzer:
I guess my question is, is the cont reference you get from being switched to a unique one or just reused (and passed for convenience)
TLively:
They're one-shot IIUC
Ross Tate:
My understanding is that it’s “fresh” and it’s “single shot”.

Thomas:

They are continuations and they are delimited (in some sense) but they may not be "delimited continuations"

Ross:

There are losses: it requires either boxing/gc or closed-world compilation when other proposals would not. This is not due to “delimitation”, but due to its switching model.

Sam:

technically all continuations are ultimately delimited, but for this delimitation to be useful we need a way of composing such continuations which one cannot have with a bag of stacks approach - think a way of splicing stacks together

Daniel:

every continuation is delimited, even the undelimited ones (the delimiter is at the top of the program), however, what people mean when they say delimited continuations is really composable continuations. Composable continuations have a particular definition

Thomas:

@Luke, the big trade off for the simplicity is the extra complexity and no "automatic" composability for compilation schemes and ABIs for situations where separate source-level features need to be supported simultaneously via stack switching.

Luke:

@Thomas Lively yeah, I can see that. Still, I wonder if this is just “business as usual” when you design the ABI for your language

Thomas:

That's definitely a good question. Will want to hear more from language teams to answer it.

Daniel:

informally, composable continuation means that the invocation of the continuation splices the captured context with the current execution context.
