### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion


Raw Chat log:

*	Sam Lindley:	https://docs.google.com/document/d/13raLPzB4vRxnzmjezCIN-AFjsT4rGDK7l7rdHDdi75g/edit
*	Thomas Lively:	"As low level as possible, but no lower"
*	Luke Wagner:	Reacted to ""As low level as pos..." with üëç
*	Benjamin Titzer:	I found that NANDScript was maybe too low? üôÇ
*	Benjamin Titzer:	Thinking more in the background, could this proposal be loosened so that you can only switch to a suspended stack (not a moribund or running one)?
*	Ross Tate:	That‚Äôs already its semantics; if you try to switch to a non-suspended stack, you trap.
*	Benjamin Titzer:	I guess my question is, is the cont reference you get from being switched to a unique one or just reused (and passed for convenience)
*	Thomas Lively:	They're one-shot IIUC
*	Ross Tate:	My understanding is that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and it‚Äôs ‚Äúsingle shot‚Äù.
*	Zalim Bashorov:	https://gist.github.com/fgmccabe/afe8bdfdf2ffdc94d69252683f376d15
*	Thomas Lively:	They are continuations and they are delimited (in some sense) but they may not be "delimited continuations"
*	Ross Tate:	There are losses: it requires either boxing/gc or closed-world compilation when other proposals would not. This is not due to ‚Äúdelimitation‚Äù, but due to its switching model.
*	Thomas Lively:	@Luke, the big trade off for the simplicitly is the extra complexity and no "automatic" composability for compilation schemes and ABIs for situations where separate source-level features need to be supported simultaneously via stack switching.
*	Sam Lindley:	technically all continuations are ultimately delimited, but for this delimitation to be useful we need a way of composing such continuations which one cannot have with a bag of stacks approach - think a way of splicing stacks together
*	Daniel Hillerstr√∂m:	every continuation is delimited, even the undelimited ones (the delimiter is at the top of the program), however, what people mean when they say delimited continuations is really composable continuations. Composable continuations have a particular definition
*	Luke Wagner:	@Thomas Lively yeah, I can see that.  Still, I wonder if this is just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù when you design the ABI for your language
*	Thomas Lively:	That's definitely a good question. Will want to hear more from language teams to answer it.
*	Daniel Hillerstr√∂m:	informally, composable continuation means that the invocation of the contiunuation splices the captured context with the current execution context.
*	Thomas Lively:	Reacted to "informally, compos..." with üëç
