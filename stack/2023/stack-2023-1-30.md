### Adoption of the agenda

### Typed Continuations in Wasmtime

LPC presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yh6fu0NfuyiBJAfPG2PaSlB4v9Tmot6yUNQVZcg5K1c/edit#slide=id.g201398232bd_0_83)

LPC: Static semantics were easy to implement as specified, but the dynamic semantics are specified in terms of rewriting rules, so we had to do something else.

LPC demos odd-even program running on wasmtime.

FM: You get rid of a stack when you finally return from it?

LPC: Yes, in theory. Right now it just leaks. We should be able to solve it with reference counting.

FM: I thought func.bind wasn’t happening?

LPC: Right, that and `let` both were removed from the spec proposals so we were able to avoid working on them. The initialization checking that replaced `let` was pretty easy to implement.

FM: What happens if you call a C function inside Wasmtime?

LPC: I’d have to try it! The stack switching is predictable. The trampoline between Wasm and C is super simple–just checks that your registers are saved. Should mostly just work.

FM: C programs don’t check for stack overflow.

SL: How big are the stacks?

LPC: Fixed, size provided when a fiber is created.

SL: We can experiment with this later.

AR: How does libmprompt handle this in a C environment?

SL: Uses virtual memory so it can grow without moving.

AR: Might fail, right?

AR: The efficient passing of arguments would probably require abandoning the fiber ABI and doing it yourself, right?

LPC: Daniel’s idea is to put the values directly on the stack.

DH: We can look at the types to figure out the size on the stack. Right now it’s just a box.

AR: I would think we would want ot pass these in registers eventually. What stack are the values written to?

DH: The receiving stack. Since you know the types, you can reserve space up front and pass a pointer. This should be compatible with the fiber API.

LPC: If you want to save it in a register, you definitely have to do something different since the fiber API clobbers saved registers.

AR: Did you have thoughts about what calling conventions you might use if you had full control?

DH: I haven’t thought about that.

AR: Would you want to match the function call convention or is there a reason to do something different?

DH: Not sure.

LPC: Could definitely pass in caller-saved registers.

SL: What’s the next step?

LPC: Benchmarking. Would love to see how we can start writing some programs and running them.

FM: Can you share an estimate of the number of hours you spent implementing it?

LPC: If you don’t count function references, it’s not that bad.

DH: We were completely new to the wasmtime code base and jumped right into function references.

LPC: Static semantics was not more than a week. Fiber.new and resume was another week. Then another very busy week working together.

DH: Most pieces are there already. It was just a matter of putting them together.

AR: How hard would it be for you to inline whatever wasmtime does, i.e. to generate the code directly for these primitives.

LPC: Wouldn’t be too bad. Would have to go through ISLE (wasmtime’s code gen backend infrastructure) because wasmtime is opinionated about generating arch-independent code.

DH: Hard part might be segmented stacks. Would want help from someone working on wasmtime.

AR: One thing you didn’t show is what the trampoline or liftoff code you generate for cont.new. You probably need to generate some code that handles the first resume and handles terminating the continuation, right?

LPC shows assembly implementing the trampoline. Q&A ensues.

SL: Who imposes the CFI requirements?

LPC: Yeah wasmtime ran this. If you mess it up you can’t run gdb on it.

RT: You system is implemented on top of the wasmtime Fiber API, so how does it do dynamic scoping?

DH: It always returns to the parent, so it needs to jump from parent to parent to find the correct handle. You get a “resume button” that takes you to the parent, and the parent changes over time as the continuation is resumed.

FM: The fibers API is very similar to the Python greenlets API.

RT: Right, where each fiber has a mutable reference to the parent.

FM: One of the things we’re concerned about in JSPI is calls to C code in a way that doesn’t crash the browser. Have you thought about that? Like switching to a central stack for C code?

SL: The obvious badness is the stack overflow.

AR: That’s orthogonal because you can always overflow the stack whether it’s been switched or not.

SL: Other spectrum of Francis’s question is what happens if you create a million stacks.

FM: Right, if they’re fixed size, then most of the space is wasted, but otherwise you need growable stacks.

SL: Would be interesting to try plugging in libmprompt or segmented stacks as a different backend. What’s V8 doing?

FM: Growable, segmented stacks.

IR: Will be presenting on this next week.

FM: We’ll also switch to a central stack to run C, which I would prefer not to do.

SL: But at least it’s safe.

RT: Another issue is that some systems assume the stack is linear and will break if that breaks.

FM: We have that problem. For example, if one of the C functions does a stack walk, and they do for profiling at least, then that caused a crash until we fixed it.

RT: Windows SEH has similar assumptions.

FM: Can you talk about exceptions?

LPC: Right, the dynamic semantics are not implemented yet in wasmtime.

SL: Do you know what the plan is for exceptions in wasmtime?

DH: Yes, they will be implemented. Someone else has committed to doing it.

RT: What portions have to be specialized for each platform?

LPC: Just the portion I showed earlier. There’s also a Windows-specific version of that code.

AR: So the allocation of new stacks is normal Rust allocation?

LPC: Yes. It’s an MMAP with a guard page.

RT: I thought Windows required allocating stacks with a special mechanism?


FM: That’s for CFI, but Microsoft hasn’t implemented that for Windows yet. Maybe the CFI in wasmtime is a different kind of CFI?

DH: This CFI is not control flow integrity, but control frame instructions, used for debugging.

FM: How does the segmented nature of the stack show up on GDB when there is a backtrace?

DH: It shows the jump to the other stack. It works quite naturally. You have a linear segment for each stack.

FM: Can you see that it is segmented?

DH: You see different addresses.

FM: I’d like this group to consider debugging in the future. We’re just starting to look at this in V8/DevTools. It’s hard to debug programs that switch stacks like this.

RT: Implementing effect handlers on top of the fibers API, have you found any deficiencies in the API for your purposes?

LPC: As mentioned before, the 2N crawl up and down the linked list is suboptimal.

SL: First step is to run benchmarks.

DH: Also had to extend the header format for more context for child stack pointers.

AR: So you wanted more control over the stack format than the library gave you? There’s also the problem of passive values in registers.

FM: My guess is that if you make all these changes, there won’t be much of the Fibers API left.

SL: Any good suggestions for benchmarks?

FM: Sieve of aristothenes with a separate continuation for each filter.

SL: Anything more real?

TL: Would need toolchain support.

DH: Talked to some people interested in compiling their languages down to this.

SL: We can take any program that uses asyncify.

LPC: For example ruby and go use asyncify for their stack switching.
