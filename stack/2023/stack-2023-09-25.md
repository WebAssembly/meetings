### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

#### Discussion on JSPI/core stack switching integration

FM Presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WTzcNXHVKZjdLnmxtdnT___BVmqTTjIkpZniIv9OkTw)


RH: Would it be possible to go back to the slide with the SS application that used JSPI? Is each one of these boxes a different boxed? What does it represent? 

FM: Each one of them represents a different coroutine? 

RH: The scheduler calls a different stack..?

FM: You can implement the scheduler however you want, its not important for the scheduler to running in its own computation, if you have it so that the logic of the scheduler is distributed across the tasks, the data structure for the scheduler is messed up, it would only work if the data structure is global to the whole program. Also, this is a simpler picture.. (However.. slide) will show up between components, there’s no shared linking between the components

RH: Let’s stay on a single component slide. Why should a scheduler not be aware of the computations? And be able to handle different resume patterns

FM: That is one solution, there is another problem with that, many languages/libraries that support coroutining, they also allow their applications to do their own scheduling, in Loom you can write your own scheduler, if you’re bringing your own scheduler, then the users schedulers also need to be aware of this. If you have a Kotlin web specific scheduler, it wouldn’t have the same freedom that a non-web scheduler would have to do fine tuning of user applications. You can, but it will affect the difficulty of bringing an application to the web

RH: The solution that I would think of is that the scheduler should be aware of how the host should schedule this application, 

FM: There is another thing, there has to be agreement across the boundaries, what this means is that the integration between the tasks and scheduler, task2 can wake up the scheduler, even though the scheduler is waiting for someone else. You could do this, it’s made substantially harder if you have a hierarchical model of coroutining, the scheduler may not be in a resumable state, which is where the actual core stack switching model will matter (SLIDE: Task2s promise gets resolved)

AR: Isn’t that true here as well? Because you can get into an inconsistent state, I can’t claim that I fully understand the state that, it looks like you’re running into the problem of composing multiple effects, this is what effect handlers are supposed to do, but it might not be able to solve this because JS layer is not composable

FM: This is caused by composability, and not solved by it. All the hierarchical effect handlers need to know about each other

AR: If you do it carefully, they don’t need to know about each other, that’s the point of effect handlers, it has to invoke the right effect, depending on why it suspends, it needs to go to the right resume point

FM: It doesn’t know that it was resumed in a  funny state, in a hierarchical system, task2 would not be resumable by itself, it has to be resumed by itself

AR: In a hierarchical system, it has to say what it reason it suspends, by construction the baseline only handler you suspend to will only know how to resume

FM: Its woken up by the event loop, the hierarchy has been bypassed

AR: The hierarchy has been bypassed, not suspended, that's always the case, if you have these types of hierarchical structures, you can only resume… only the point that you have suspended to can resume

FM: That is the logic that I was assuming, however, if you go back to (focusing on semantics slide), these are the current semantics for JSPI. S.suspend is a legitimate thing to do, the issue is that we cannot, or should not take the form S.resume, because that is what causes the crash, the then function is not called by the scheduler, its called by the event loop, its bypassing the natural hierarchy of the tasks. We can make this work if we don’t resume the thing we suspend, if we don’t resume what we suspend, what do we resume? The top level task might be the one to resume, and we have to figure out what task it restartable, and if we go to the component model, the other component doesn’t know which task is resumable, then it needs to pass something to say which task can be resumable


AR: Agree that there’s a problem when we go to the Wasm boundary, JS is just not expressible (or JS as the proxy for the web architecture) is not expressible enough, and we have to work around it somehow
FM: Agree, if we do this in a real OS, when you create a promise, this is half of a pair, there’s a computation that is suspended, and another that has a resumable pair. With the promise architecture half of that is outside of our control, in a real OS, they’re both in control of the application, so the scheduler can be made aware locally, that’s the thing missing on Web architectures

AR: The fundamental problem here is that you want some.. The user space shceuler, and the WebAssembly scheduler somehow need to coordinate, because they’re not hierarchical, together they have to collaborate as one big scheduler, that’s inherently not composable. The scenario is very specific, and not necessarily related to component boundary

LW: In a multi-language scenario with different layers, you do want this hierarchical two-layer scheduler, what is the JSAPI between core Wasm? JSPI is close, but not sufficient. There’s a different lower level JSAPI, there should be a continuation reference that can flow in/out of JS. When you have a continuation reference, that accepts a promise, what does that mean? <TODO: LW to fill in> 


AR: Except what FM was talking about was that we need more than two levels..

LW: I think you only need two levels of scheduling, one at a top level and one intra-componen, you can avoid the n-level computing

RT: 

LW: Kotlin can do it that way, and when you have a different language implementing it in a different way, then that’s when the component model makes sense. When it’s all one language, we can assume there’s a common ABI and the modules can share memory etc., and that tis all core wasm.
