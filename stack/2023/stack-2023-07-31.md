## Meeting Notes

SL: Will we still need core stack switching for core stack switching?

IR: Safe to stay on secondary stacks as long as it's Wasm-to-Wasm. Runtime calls will still still switch to central stack.

SL: Any radical differences between what we need to do for core stack switching and JSPI?
IR: No, it will be very similar. Most of the extra work for core stack switching will be API interface work.

TL (chat): (re: Wasm-to-Wasm wrappers) It would be really surprising if a Wasm-Wasm boundary became observable for any reason.

RT (chat): I believe heâ€™s talking about where the suspender-wrapping functions are applied to a wasm function and the resulting wrapped function is used as a wasm function.

IR: For example SQLite wants to provide a sync API for users. They would want full control at the boundary of their library to ensure that sync API.

FM: You could either call the wrapped import or you could call the unwrapped import and propagate the suspended object. We haven't implemented removing the wrappers when a wrapped import is hooked up to a wrapped export, and we may never do that.

TL: Thanks, it makes sense for the boundary to be observable when there is an explicit wrapper between the import and the export.
