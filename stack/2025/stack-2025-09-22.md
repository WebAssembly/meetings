FM presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZT7ZWqC9zc2l_Q5dxPhBCUd7bX2_v9pQvsv29fis94M)

FM: Would like to start burning down issues ahead of going to phase 3 at the October face-to-face.

Conclusion: Follow up with Maxime to see if they are able to close it out, if not someone else would need to fix remaining issues and merge. Likely not much work remaining

Cont top type, nothing to be done for this issue as br_if already violates this issue so we don’t need to change resume semantics. It’s working as intended and also the conservative choice.

Cont type casting <tlively> to present, we’ll talk about missing instructions after

### Adjourn

Next meeting will be on Oct 6th.
