## Agenda items

1. JSPI: Final thoughts (Francis McCabe)

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

FM: Plan to go for phase 4 vote tomorrow.

SD: The first proposal I engaged with. Thanks for the opportunity.

It may be a game changer for Scala on the web. I think there will be many libraries that will take advantage of it.

Shipped a user-facing API recently.

FM: Discussed some of the issues around specifying the semantics of JSPI: in particular the three-way impedance mismatch between the way that Ecmascript is specified, WebAssembly is specified and the semantics we were trying to capture.
