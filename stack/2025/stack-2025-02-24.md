### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

FM presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TlQmKoZEx9sA-vbb7JsGjFN5YTkIVKuzn0y13Q_An6E)

KM: Want to make sure we're all on the same page about the use case for JSPI. There was some confusion about that in the past.

FM: Straightforward purpose: enable legacy C code to be ported to WebAssembly. The assumption is that this hypothetical code uses POSIX-style APIs that are primarily synchronous. This does not work well with the Web APIs, but also now many APIs beyond the browser, e.g. in long-running enterprise transactions.

FM: Additionally, neither the JS community nor the WebAssembly want JSPI to require changes to JS or WebAssembly. Beyond that, there are additional use cases that came up, e.g. dynamic loading of code. This is important for WebAssembly because it has large binaries and lots of interesting legacy code is very large. Both Autocad and Photoshop are in the 10s of MBs. New partners want to access new APIs that have no synchronous versions, especially WebGPU.

Slide: Do you have to use secondary stacks?

FM: No.

Slide: Thoughts on Asyncify

FM: Asyncify is similar to a CPS transform, similar to the one in C# / .NET. The issue is that there is significant code bloat. 30-40% code size overhead. If your base size is 20MB, this is not acceptable. There is also performance overhead from putting local variables in memory. That being said, it is difficult to beat its performance. Indirect function calls defeat call graph analysis and cause lots of code to be instrumented. Asyncify is not re-entrant.

KM: Why are we worried about reentrancy? It seems legacy could would not be reentrant to begin with.

FM: The reentrancy comes from users e.g. clicking buttons multiple times. If the click handler involves a fetch, then the user clicks the button again while the fetch is happening, it shouldn't be blocked. An early version of JSPI did not support reentrancy and this was a source of cYou still have to be aware of the reentrancy in the C code.

TL: There are two layers here. Your C code may or may not be safe in the face of reentrancy, but since it is possible to write reentrancy-safe code, it needs to be possible for the platform to support that.

KM: Seems like a nice-to-have more than a hard requirement?


FM: That's what we originally thought, but we were wrong. The user experience of using JSPI without reentrancy would be bad. The Dart team in particular said JSPI without reentrancy would not work for them.

TL: When we've tried to add assertions to enforce no unsafe reentrancy in Emscripten with Asyncify, users complain because it turns out they really do need reentrancy, often just to trivially set some state. So reentrancy is a hard requirement.

Slide: Thoughts on Loom

FM: Our first reaction was that copying the stack seems rather expensive. You wouldn't want to use it to implement generators, for instance. But there are some nice things: When you resume, the stack is "reinflated" incrementally. Only one frame is copied back to the stack at a time. In a scenario with a deep switch, you're not constantly copying and reinstating the stack every time. You just restore the most recent frames in the common case, which are most likely to be in cache. So this is a legitimate strategy, but I wouldn't recommend it on its own. What killed it for us was that it doesn't work with control-flow integrity (CET) on Intel chips. It works on ARM, even though re-signing the pointers has some overhead. The Loom folks don't care about CFI. This strategy works on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

Slide: Workers

FM: Keith shared how to implement something like JSPI with Workers. There have been several such experiments in the past. Secondary tasks are run on secondary threads. The problem is using threads. Can get starvation. Doesn't work with GC object, which aren't shareable.

KM: Why are we worried about GC if the motivating use case is C? Also, can't you have the GC objects on the other side of the membrane? In my proposed library, you can do reentrancy, but it has to be LIFO.

TL: GC is important because there are users beyond legacy C applications. For example, the Dart team that Francis mentioned earlier would care very much about WasmGC.

SD: I represent Scala.js and we are very interested in JSPI because there are Scala code bases that assume they can block on synchronous APIs. That's all backed by Wasm GC.

KM: I want to make sure the goal posts aren't moving. First it's legacy C applications, and now it's more.

TL: I want to point out that these goals have come into focus over several years of discussion in the community. They certainly haven't changed in the past, idk, 6 months.

FM: It hasn't changed in at least a year.

SL: In fact, at the beginning, this "killer application" of porting legacy C code wasn't even mentioned.

FM: The top-level need is providing synchronous access to asynchronous APIs. That hasn't changed in four years.

DG: I want to highlight that the core technical reasons for e.g. for Google to implement JSPI can be very different from why other people are interested in it. But the design is by committee to address all the relevant use cases, not just by Google for a particular use case.

Slide: Can/should JSPI be polyfillable?

FM: My view is that I'm not sure that JSPI should be polyfillable in any feature designed for stack switching. The fairly consistent feedback from other people is "what do you mean, of course it should!" Something like JSPI that doesn't change the language seems like it should be polyfillable in terms of core stack switching.

TL: To clarify, we're talking about polyfilling JSPI in terms of stack switching, not in terms of anything that is available today.

FM: Right. Polyfilling purely with e.g. WasmFX is not possible because you need to be able to create promises on the JS side as well. Any polyfill would require a mix of JS code and Wasm code. Doing the whole thing would be painful if you want to account for traps properly. If you're relying on WebAssembly to polyfill JSPI, then those handlers are dead after traps.

FM: Also any core stack switching proposal that requires function coloring would not work to polyfill JSPI would not work because the whole point of JSPI is to avoid changing the Wasm code, but such a solution would require changes.

FM: Idea that it is useful to have a way to opt-in to stack switching. Common response is "who cares? If you're putting together a Wasm app, you need to know what you're doing." This is very different from how the JVM does it. Surfacing the fact that a module depends on stack switching can be useful for large integrators. I have my opinion, but won't override the community.

KM: About polyfills, can you just use a try-catch on the JS side to catch traps in JS, then reject the promise? Then when you call into Wasm, you use `resume` to create a side stack?

FM: Yes, but that's part of the pain. It messes up the architecture of the polyfill. I've implemented this and it requires three layers. I can share it with you later, Keith.

FM: I'm interested in hearing other people's opinion on whether JSPI should be polyfilled.

TL: You've heard my opinion on this, but I think it would be nice if the spec for JSPI could be layered on top of core stack switching. But also we currently have a spec that doesn't require this, so it's not a hard requirement.

AR: There's also the virtualization argument. Being able to implement JS, including JSPI, on top of WebAssembly is important.

KM: But if you want JS, maybe you want the rest of the Web APIs that come with it. A lot of those aren't really virtualizable, so it's unclear where the bounds are set.

FM: For example, the V8 team doesn't want to replace JS with WebAssembly, but Fastly does.

KM (chat): I thought it was QuickJS but maybe I’m misremembering?

TL (chat): Fastly uses SpiderMonkey

BT (chat): Shopify is using QuickJS in production, FWIW

KM: But do we need the polyfill to be easy? You can always polyfill by transforming the Wasm module.

FM: If the polyfill requires changing the code to be run, it's not really a polyfill. Even if technically you could, whether you should is a different question in my view. The WebAssembly community seems very different from the Java community on this. Code that ran yesterday needs to run tomorrow, and core stack switching can negate that.

SL: I'll be blunt. Apple lodged an objection to the JSPI proposal at the CG meeting. I'd be keen to hear from Keith or David, having engaged with this presentation today, what are your thoughts? Is there anything you can tell us that you couldn't tell us before?

KM: Still waiting on legal approval to bring our alternative to core stack switching. If JSPI becomes part of the language, how does that affect how people think about core stack switching?

SL: Historically we started with core stack switching, but we saw that there are many implementation strategies. Neither JSPI nor corestack switching dictates the implementation of stack switching.

TL: They are separate from a spec POV but related from an implementation perspective, at least so far. The reason I see them as separate is that we have existing users who are using Asyncify today and are waiting for JSPI. JSPI solves a known, quantified problem and is ready to ship. In contrast, the next step for core stack switching is just prototyping and early experiments to see what the benefit can be.

FM: That's not entirely true, but we have to end.

SL: Any hope that Apple will be able to share more next meeting?

KM: Can't promise anything. Not sure I got a direct answer to my question, so we should continue the discussion in the next meeting.
