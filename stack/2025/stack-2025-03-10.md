### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

#### 1. Ask me anything about JSPI. Discussion led by Francis McCabe

FM: questions about JSPI?

KM: Do you mean beyond the poll question? 

CW: Makes sense to do the questions first

FM: I’ll ask myself a question, where are we in terms of implementation efforts and standardizing efforts - V8 implementation is completely done, there were a couple of remaining issues, we now always suspend using promise.resolve, even that is intercept-able by the user. AFAIK, that last bit isn't implemented in SpiderMonkey, but fairly certain that the implementation is ready.We also have Web Platform Tests up, so the public is monitoring what the different browsers are doing on this. We're basically ready to go.

CW: Pointed question for the Apple representatives, if the result of the poll is that we don’t require side stacks, would you still have  other objections or is that a path forward for JSPI to phase 4? 

KM: Our primary concern is the implicitation of JSPI compelling people to feel that the side stacks for core stack switching is essentially a requirement. If people didn't feel that way, we would be much more comfortable with JSPI.

FM: I have said on multiple occasions that JSPI doesn’t imply using side stacks. Definition of a secondary stack is that it is a low level representation with multiple locations where the stack pointer is legal. 

SL: A question about that: are you saying you shouldn’t be allowed to change the stack pointer to point to a different chunk of memory from the main stack? 

FM: Generated code changes the stack pointer all the time, there is a predicate that the stack pointer is in a given region, and that region can be defined by an upper and lowe limit? 

SL: Keith, is that aligning with what you call side stacks? 

KM: Yes, mostly - the core stack switching proposal defines a series of these regions, and any implementation that does not use it would be disadvantaged. The specification would define that implementation 

TL: Is it moving the stack pointer to point to heap-allocated stacks that is the problem, or is it the existence of the stack-like data on the heap?

KM: It is primarily, not necessarily about JSPI, its more about do those stack pointers move between different logical threads in the process

BT: Is there a limitation on how big the stack segment could be? There’s a region where the pointer could go to anywhere in that region? Could there be a 4G segment that you could then treat differently

KM: Once we have core stack switching, the next logical step is to make it work between OS level pthreads

FM: The current proposals for JSPI & core stack switching do not take into accounts, there aren’t plans at this time for threads, anything we do will have to be revisited with internal threads. JSPI Doesn’t prevent moving across threads, also off the table for the current 

CW: The proposal that makes that a reality is even more ambitious, shared suspendable continuatiuons - non-shared continuations are just ok, but if shared suspendable threads have certain restrictions, that would be ok to call out

TL: The shared continuations will be distinguished at the type level from the non-shared continuations, so it will be feasible for an engine to use different implementation strategies for each of them.

KM: Fair enough, we would prefer a solution that doesn’t do that. That’s only one half of the discussion for core stack switching. We can have the whole discussion, on our end, the primary point of contention is if we would be locking ourselves into side stacks if JSPI was standardized?

SL: Neither JSPI nor stack switching locks you into an implementation with side stacks. Both have several plausible implementations that don’t require side stacks. 

BT (chat): It’s semantically invisible to the Wasm program.

FM: Preventing all possible standard extensions would be hard. I don't want to pollute our near-term discussions of whether we want JSPI and later this year whether we want core stack switching with discussion of future extensions that may or may not happen. Once we have core stack switching, new extensions will have to be figured out by new proposals.

FM: When we started looking at implementing JSPI and core stack switching, it was clear in V8 that we wanted to use side stacks, but they're not without downsides. Profiling is essentially broken, and it's not obvious how to fix it. We do something similar to what DevTools does when profiling async tasks. There are also constraints from V8 embedders we don't control. Given what I know now, I think the Loom-style approach has more merit than I originally thought. It might be interesting to hear more about how project Loom is handling these issues. Overall cost is a slightly slower return from a function if you've just resumed a stack because there's an extra trampoline. I now think it's consistent with Intel CET, which I didn't previously believe. I still think this would be harder to implement.

SL: Possible concern with the approach, when you suspend, you copy a chunk of the stack, when you resume you copy it back onto the main stack. A concern would be a pointer into the stack that you suspended. 

FM: Wasm doesn't permit it, JS doesn’t permit it. If you do it, it’s up to the engine to figure out how to support it.

SL: Keith, is that something that could be a concern for Apple?

KM: We don’t do that, I don’t expect us to support it - its a valid thing to worry about, the most common case would be the copying collector, but that’s still not our primary concern

CW: Am I understanding, Keith, that for neither JSPI nor core stack switching, that you would only need to do a Loom-style implementation for shared continuations?

KM: In theory yes, that would be possible. The concern we have with the loom style, Loom probably works well when suspensions are somewhat rare. If you suspend all the time, you’re doing 2x the writes. 

FM: That’s not the case, its worse than 2x: x^2 if you have deep switches. That’s not how loom works. When you suspend ti copies into the side stack, but when you resume it returns one frame at a time. The argument there was that when you return from a function, the frame that you return is loaded into the cache anyway. The only thing you’re doing is that you’re preloading in the cache. What you do then is that when that function returns, you copy the next frame and you implement that with the trampoline. That trampoline would enable .. once you resume that side call, its the trampoline that is doing the callr return mechanism

BT: If you wanted to do the indirection, you can only copy the data required for indirection, so the stack data from the heap

CW: If this applies only to shared suspendable stacks, it is several years away and we can have additional restrictions there. 

FM: V8 would also probably prefer to implement shared suspendable functions with a loom-style approach because we don't want stack memory migrating between threads. 

CW: put a trampoline on every shared-suspendable function?

FM: Yes. That is in the future, and I don't want to speak for my future self.

KM: I get the loom one, the point about the 2x when frequently suspending, and I would assume popping one at a time, just assume you have an async-await loop, and every frame suspend, you always suspend after each function call. With the loom style you’re always copying out in the worst case, and you have to copy it back its actually 3x the writes each frame, if suspensions are rare, then the copy isn’t that expensive

FM: It depends on the application but ina  very intense coroutining environment you’re not going that often. Golang, Erlnag don’t switch most of the time

TL: The language where core semantics are that they switch every frame, then you’re not likely using JSPI & stack switching

KM: That transformation is just Asyncify, and the motivation was to get rid of it

SL: In the case that an Asyncify-like transform is required, it’s fine to have it, but always having to do it is quite expensive. In the niche cases that it is actually needed, it is fine to do that sort of transform

TL: There's a big difference between a compiler frontend doing a state machine transformation when it knows it's compiling a stackless coroutine and the Asyncify Wasm-to-Wasm.

KM: What are you doing that the wasm-wasm transform can do?

TL: When you know you’re doing a stackless coroutine, you can do tail call between state machines, and split it across several functions, and do whatever you need to make it a really efficient state machine. Asyncify takes what you have and adds additional control flow on top of it, so it isn’t breaking your existing control flow, maybe it reasons across things that are live across suspension points. I think it's pretty different.

FM: I’ve asked the Kotlin compiler folks, how would they move forward with core stack switching? Kotlin coroutines are used for yield style generator and coroutines, its probably marginal to implement generators. For some languages which have restricted forms of integration, doing the CPS forms of transformation may not involve stack switching of any form at all

SL: Zalim, anything to add to what Francis is saying about Kotlin?

ZB (chat): No, at this point.

#### Informal poll on the relationship between JSPI and core-stacks by Keith Miller (15m)

SL: You’re asking the room? Or have an opinion that you’d like to state? 

KM: Don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner

BT: The poll is more of a technical question, should we change it to should? 

CW: It’s the degree of agreement

BT: We’re talking about implementation details, and not the design itself. Core stack switching already does not require side stacks.

DG: Maybe we should let other people speak.

SD: As a user rather than implementer of WebAssembly, I can detach from the implementation details better. Is this question really about whether core stack switching might have stackless semantics?

SL: Do you mean stack switching not have side stacks?

SD: I’m trying to understand if having side stacks in this question is equivalent to having stackful coroutining? 

SL: If there is anyone who is disagreeing with the noisy people who are saying that neither stack switching nor JSPI implies side stacks - we’re interested in hearing from them? 

CW: Even if it did expose side stacks, it is specific to shared continuations? 

KM: We’re worried that JSPI , maybe not technically but philosophically, will opt into using a stackful style of coroutine. Second concern is there’s a core use case of async-awaits that are not particularly served by current stack switching designs. We talked about that with asyncify. We would like to explore solutions that work in those contexts as well. 

TL: Honestly, my default state was that having some future core stack switching proposal would be nice to have these proposals layer nicely in the spec and the implementation. IF that makes you unhappy, then I’m happy to say that i’m not categorically opposed to saying that I can put those concerns on the side if it helps ship JSPI

CW: Not sure how this relates to Keith's technical concerns or the poll.

TL: My read is that Keith has technical concerns, but the poll is really about decoupling JSPI and core stack switching at a design and process level.

SL: If the design has to preclude a side stack approach and requires an Asyncify-like transformation, then that would be bad, too.

CW: want to say more forcefully - we shouldn’t speculatively throw out our current feature proposals. Keith has raised two specific concerns and neither would be addressed by switching to a stackless feature.

FM: Want to make sure there is a bright line about JSPI. It addresses different use cases than core stack switching and allows for different implementations. It's ok if one is not polyfillable in terms of the other.

**Poll**: We expect that JSPI's existence will mean that any future core-stack switching design is side-stack based.

Results: 

Agree: 0

Neutral: 3

Disagree: 10

KM: I feel better about JSPI given the results of this poll.
