## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

FM presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iDomt9mJdocJporD2PvsuOpjqemV_DyK8FRTK0QD9KY/)

LI: With stack walking, would C still need a shadow stack?

RT: Yes, C would. With a different “limited lifetime pointers” idea for interior pointers into the stack, many languages would be able to use that instead. But until then they need shadow stacks (possibly heterogeneous).

LI: What do you mean by heterogeneous?

RT: Mixed linear memory and reference values on the shadow stack.

LI: Runtime integration with run loop, had to manually exit to the JS event loop. Would be nice to not have to do.

FM: Depends on application. Database application w/ async IO would have to be more aggressive about returning to the event loop than even a video application.

RT: Could have a “check in with JS” event that is triggered every so often.

LI: If we get async/await in wasm would I still have to do requestAnimationFrame()?

RT: I think a recurring event to check a timer would work as well.

LI: I’m just looking for any places we can get rid of JS so we can have a better deploying experience.

FM: Different applications will have different requirements around this…

FM: One thing you might have noticed is that stack walking is not in the requirements right now.

LI: It seems like we will need stack inspection to find GC roots in Erlang anyway.

PS: We could use a shadow stack as well if we had to. The most important thing is having some form of stackful coroutines/green threads/continuations.

LI: You’re right, but it still seems weird that everyone needs a shadow stack and there isn’t better support for that.

LI: I hope we can do this in less than three years.

FM: Hopefully by making requirements solid up front we will be able to do that.

FM/RT: Want feedback on requirements.

LI: Definitely need JS Promise integration.

FM: One thing I (and others) would be interested in is whether there is anything missing from the critical use cases.

PS: You commented that async/await is the most important. For us the stackful coroutine aspect is critical as well, with entire separate stacks.

RT: And you gave a great presentation showing why that is.

SL: Do we have any other representatives who would like to similarly argue for the importance of async/await?

LI: I think Google really wants that.

FM: There are also many language implementors not present. It would be great if we could all reach out to them and let them know this is happening. Java, C# making moves in this space. Google believes async/await is important for its community of Wasm users.

RT: Luke mentioned earlier that being able to use JS Promises for async IO is important as well.

LI: It would be good to make sure that all languages with an “async” keyword can actually use the feature we design. It would be weird if they had to still ship a runtime.

SL: Interactions with existing implementations are going to be tricky, in particular JS’s existing async/await.

RT: Francis, you were saying that JS doesn’t want to add full async/await?

FM: If you are a regular JS function and you call a regular JS function, then you are entitled to believe that the only effects on the global state will be caused by the function you called. This is important to maintain for JS (and for many other languages) but the C world may be less clear on this. On the other hand if you’re an async function and you await on another async function, you know something else may happen to the global state in the meantime. We may need to have the equivalent of a critical region in our design.

RT: The JS community might give us pushback if we can capture JS frames through our async/await.

LI: Since async pollutes upward, on our JS boundary we need to guarantee that it’s async/await handlers as opposed to other event handlers. Do we need a standard JS async/await event for Wasm to use to make JS happy?

FM: Many languages have this, not just JS.

SL: We have some experience with this in the Links(?) language. Works fine if you’re not doing anything funny, but we need to think more carefully about this.

AG: If we had effect handlers and you knew you were calling an async JS function, that means enriching the JS-Wasm API in some interesting ways. If you don’t want to do that, you have to work with callbacks instead.

RT: I worked through the async/await example we had in the first-class stacks proposal, and it already doesn’t capture any JS stack frames. So could be possible to implement async/await in WebAssembly without having it spread out to JS. So you register callbacks on promises that have just Wasm stacks (rather than mixed stacks).

LI: That worked in our example. Either when the process exited or died, the `drop` on the promise executor would call reject on the Promise.

FM: Going to be more interesting with multiple modules/components. The limitations we have may reduce the utility of that because certain things like async I/O will be disallowed across those boundaries.

LI: If you’re in a web worker and you have to yield to the main thread to do I/O, do we consider that async I/O?

RM: My initial reaction is that there might be library support for that for a particular language, but it won’t be part of Wasm itself.

RT: Luke, are you getting at coordinating between different stacks on different threads?

LI: Web workers being processes rather than threads makes work-stealing schedules difficult.

RT: There are some limitations like not having concurrent access to JS processes. So for stack-stealing we would need to guarantee that JS objects aren’t shared.

LI: … JS considerations …

FM: Nothing we do is going to change anyone’s mind about how Web Workers work.

SL: We need to run experiments to see what kind of interactions there are going to be.

FM: The Web Worker story doesn’t belong to Wasm and we should not be trying to change that.

SL: My point is that there are many approaches we can try with varying effort and convenience.

LI/PS: Sad that we don’t have real threads on the Web.

RT: Current C stacks don’t have any references on them, so you can move those stacks to different threads potentially. We haven’t been able to investigate in much detail.

LI: Do we expect to test this in implementations? Wasmtime? I know the browser is difficult.

FM: Multiple places. We are looking at V8, others (e.g. Arjun) are looking at Wasmtime. V8 will take longer.
LI: We can try it as long as LLVM supports it in assembly.

TL: Not a problem to add it to LLVM assembly.

SL: Should we try multiple designs?

AG: Could quickly try multiple strategies in Wasmtime, would be significant work but could be done. Hard to do in toolchains as well.

SL: We should be able to do this quickly for research languages and e.g. the reference interpreter. But after that we need to work on bigger engines and languages.

LI: Does multicore OCaml compile to WebAssembly?

SL: No.

FM: Next scheduled meeting is December 28. Suggest to skip that meeting.

SL: Next meeting is January 11.

FM: No agenda for that meeting yet.

SL: Do you have someone who can talk about the implementation of async/await in V8?

FM: I will attempt to locate someone who can talk about this.
