## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

Donald Pinckney presentation on Wasm/k

DP: C vs Go performance on Wasm
DP: Go’s performance on Wasm not so great
DP: Two sources of inefficiency: green threads and GC
DP: Go needs to spill all locals onto shadow stack
DP: Developed C/k as a simple extension to C that has stack manipulation primitives
DP: C/K adds control(), restore(), continuation_copy(), continuation_delete() and prompt()
DP: Wasm/k semantics in terms of small steps
DP: Use stacks of continuation tables to enforce delimited continuation copies



### Closure
