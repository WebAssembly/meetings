### Adoption of the agenda

## Meeting Notes

PH: “We need means of unwinding stack and we need finally blocks”

PH: six primitives for control flow in LISP: if & tagbody/go & block/return from & catch/throw

PH: CL is compiled to byte/native code

PH: CL ANSI standard 1994

FM: What happens when cleanup throws or does a non-local exit?

PH: Clean up code may throw or perform a non-local exit.

RT: Are you planning on illustrating that return-from can do non-local control flow, not just local branches?

PH: Yes.

SL: What happens if bar has already returned and is no longer on the stack?

PH: Signals a CONTROL-ERROR

RT: One more thing: If there were multiple calls to bar on the stack, it doesn’t necessarily go to the most recent one, right?

PH: Each instance on the stack creates a new association between the block and the corresponding return-from, so it may not be the most recent on the stack.

FM: Can return-from take a variable?

PH: No, the return-from target must be a static name.

FM: Question about static target of return-from. How is that typically implemented?

PH: (Explanation on slides 204-209) Compiler generates a variable to track whether the target frame is still on the stack. The implementation of return-from checks that variable before starting the unwind.

RT: confirms understanding

FM: One of the differences between WebAssembly and normal programming languages: if we had something like `%1-phase-unwind-to-tag`, it would be unsafe because we can’t guarantee that the code to guard the unwind is generated correctly.

… discussion …

FM/AR: Wasm has to run in a hostile environment. Have to protect embedder from malicious Wasm.

LW: IIUC, there is a reference that might live longer than its associated block. Are there other use cases you’ve seen for that?

PH: These guard variables are typically allocated on the heap...

LW: One way of doing a search phase we’ve discussed is using stack inspection, but if we had this sort of reference to data on the stack, we could also use that to do the first phase.

RT: There’s another complication: The soundness of the validity tag check depends on the fact that the checking code is on the same stack as the frame it is checking the existence of.

PH: If we create a new stack that just contains CL frame information…

RT: If we had these stack reference values, we would need to reason about what stack they reference in the type system (in a future with multiple Wasm stacks).

AR: This may need ??? because Lisp has closures.

PH: Yes, the Java implementation similarly uses objects to close over things similarly. I don’t know how this would be represented in WebAssembly.

SL: I was hoping you would show resumable exceptions.

PH: We are out of time, but there is information on that in the video I shared.
