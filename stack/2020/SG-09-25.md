## Meeting Notes


### Introduction of attendees

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion: 

TL: We should be making decisions
PS: Agreed. Would like to follow this.
HA: Stack Switching should not be connected to EH. Hoping the EH is independent of other stack switching proposals.
LI: It would be nice if stack switching is more important than stack inspection
PS: We cant target WASM at the moment.
SL: Our proposal is intended to be minimal. Incremental approach is best

LI: We need stack switching for async/await too.
SL: We propose generalize to cover more use cases. 
PS: We are interested in multiple use cases.
LI: Does implementation need to infer special cases to obtain optimization. 
SL: GHC does support efficient implementations of effect handlers; through aggressive inlining.

FM: In summary, topics include exception handling, async/await, coroutining as use cases.

FM: Meeting on friday is not good for Europeans. Suggest meeting every two weeks on Mondays, starting October 5th.

FM: We have volunteers for two presentations in coming weeks: from SL (a backgrounder on effects handling) and PS/LI (on what it takes to implement Erlang)
