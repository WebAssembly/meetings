## Meeting Notes

Note: Luke Wagner is presenting an interface types update at the next SOIL seminar

RT's slides on Stack Mechanisms: [(pdf)](presentations/2020-11-02-tate-stack-policies.pdf) [(pptx)](presentations/2020-11-02-tate-stack-policies.pptx)

RT: Dynamically scoped variables as a gateway to looking at stack mechanisms
RT: Implementation strategy #1: global variable
RT: Strategy #2: pass mutable dictionary of variables
RT: Strategy #3: Pass immutable dictionary
RT: WebAssembly challenges
RT: Interop with host
RT: Extensions for algebraic effects
RT: Stack marking
RT: Strategy #4: Use code ranges to find marks on stacks. Lazy
RT: Strategy #5: Use a dictionary with each stacklet. Eager
RT: Dynamic scoping is not a low-level primitive (too many choices for implementation)
RT: Stack walking is a primitive
RT: Red Flag: policy
AZ: Can’t you use a shadow stack instead of adding a special feature for stack walking
LW: Arbitrary stack switching may get scrambled when you are crossing ABI boundaries
SL: What happens if dynamic scoping is already implemented using another feature? E.g., dynamic scoping can be implemented using effect handlers or other control operators. What is your primary concern?
RT: Efficiency is a concern: there are 5 identified strategies for dynamic scoping

RT: Stack Policies presentation
RT: Policies for interop across Wasm ecosystem
RT: Stack unwinding policies
RT: Sandboxing vs Unwinding
RT: Trap causes required unwinders to be skipped as well as untrusted unwinders
RT: Can we infer privilege
RT: Basic questions about policies

LW: If the sandboxing goes wrong, what about the non-stack state. What about the mutable state? 
Use a larger unit - component/store.
Concept of a ‘blast zone’ to predefine sandboxing.
RT: Looking for privilege concepts
LW: Firefox added a hard blast zone to avoid leaks of information
SL: Do you want a blast zone for each green thread? How expensive are they?
LW: Web workers are expensive
RT: Need to access all GC roots 
LW: Some thinking about managing TLS memory.
LI: Stack based security has some attack scenarios
LW:
