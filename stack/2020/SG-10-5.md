## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion: 

SL: General introduction to effect handlers as a programming formalism

SL: Programs must interact typically using ad hoc features

SL: Effect Handlers generalize 

SL: Invented by Gordon Plotkin & Matija Pretnar

SL: Composable and customizable

SL: github semantic library based on EFH. 

SL: Underlying React

SL: EFH as composable user-defined operating systems

SL: EFH generalize Exception Handling

LI: How expensive is this. Can you do a counting yield as we do in Lumen/Erlang?

SL: Current example only has one handler. 

SL: Cooperative concurrency

LI: Every process in Erlang has a monitor process. Has a exception handler.

SL: One wants exceptions to be handled within the process

LI: The scheduler handles the exception by propagating to linked processes.
SL: Lynx has a similar model to Erlang
RT: We did not permit arbitrary stack copying because its an attack vector
SL: Can model pipes & pipes
LI: Yield is ubiquitous in Erlang. We dont use CPS directly.
LI: If we use EFH for implementation do we have to tell browsers to implement a stack switch? We dont use CPS directly
SL: We dont do everything at once. We should be trying simpler aspects such as async/await & green threads first. Donâ€™t necessarily use EFH everywhere.
LI: We are most concerned about stack switching. 
RT: Does erlang always use a trampoline for switching threads?
LI: Yes, but it is not important.
LI: GOing back to the scheduler is important to be able to go back to the browser event loop.
TL: LLVM assembler will support low level features.
