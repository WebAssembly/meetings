### Discussion

#### [Task-based Stack Switching](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1veLRa4d4B0dM3BU_8A39A1uu1bBFH_05GaWphF_4otQ) (Francis McCabe)

SL: an important difference between these events and those used by typed continuations is that they do not have result types

FM: Yes

RT: retire is a bit like a dynamically typed version of returning

RT: For the task.retire, you can also use it for dynamically typed returning to the parent

FM: Yes, it will be everytime you want to finish

RT: Reference to SL, it’s a dynamically typed return instead of a static one 

FM: The event is statically typed

RT: <>

SL<in chat>:People may find it helpful to refer to Francis' PR here: https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/blob/fgmccabe-patch-2/proposals/tasks/Explainer.md

SL: Compared to the typed continuations proposal, you always specify who is going to handle the event
