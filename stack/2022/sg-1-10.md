### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion:

#### Towards an ontology of stack switching (Francis McCabe)

Francis McCabe (FMC) presenting slides.

- Sam Lindley (SL): Many claims, not sure I understand them all, high level, what is a resource exactly. What does it even mean, or how can you measure the claim that resources are better than a function. What is a resource? Is it an OO object?
- FMC: Aristotle talked about the representation of the thing, the thing, the effect (affordance) of the thing.
  Triangle of identity - affordance - thing
- SL: That doesn't answer my question, what are we talking about here in terms of Wasm?
- Luke Wagner (LW): Wasm things, like instances, they don't have an end. Do we care about semantically defining the lifetimes and ownerships of things? If we say that resources are things with lifetimes and ownership of other resources, they have relationships, dependencies, etc. This should be more formal, parent/child or hierarchy of ownership. So if we define resources like this, then it seems it's a way we can describe a stack or concurrent computation. So this is not so relevant to ...[missed]... design, but it's good to have the notion.
- Ben Titzer (BT): The point concerning modelling (not design) is how do we bind the things we model.
- SL: Lifetimes? Is this against having a resource as a first class value?
- LW: Not necessarily, being a first class value is not necessarily conflicting with having a lifetime.
- SL: Ok but how does this all fit concretely?
- FMC: Not trying to design at this point.
- SL: I'm not even clear what the model is.
- FMC: That's what I'm trying to get to, not trying to design here.
- SL: You have a model though, right?
- FMC: The way I think about it is trying to establish terminology around this concept.
- LW: For example threads, a task that is like a stack, in GC we have an overall computation/task with possibly many spawned processes. Can we describe this in terms of resources with lifetimes? It's one stack that's growing and shrinking but one overall task.
- BT: Do we need to make these stacks really small, if we want them used heavily? They are like events happenning in the lifetime of a stack. ...[missed]...
- SL: I would like to see an example showing the benefits concretely.
- FMC: It would be good to have identity for stacks.
- SL: In Andreas's spec there is an identity for continuations.
- FMC: The notion of a task is closer to a POSIX thread. It has a persistent identity, which doesn't change.
- SL: So you're saying that if we naivly create a new identity every time we need a resource, then it would be better if we had a notion of a task?
- ...[missed discussion]...
- SL: What my question boils down to is whether we need to build this knowledge in our low level model, or can we do this in a library? ...[missed]... Disadvantages of simulating this on top of something that didn't expose certain resources would be difficulty in generating efficient code.
- LW: A year ago tried to map abstract spec down to an implementation so I can feel I have a cost model, a clear cost model seems like we all want to have. So a clear concept of a task, clear lifetimes, and a concept for when do I make new tasks, when do they get reused. A clear cost model could be a concrete benefit to have more present in the formal spec itself.
- FMC: That is an interesting idea of a cost model.
- LW: And a task or resource would be a straight up feature. If we have the notion of a task clearly defined maybe it doesn't become semantically visible other than cost model stuff, but maybe later it does, because a task will have storage, and even I wonder if there is structural concurrency things, like task ownership, with invariants like child tasks. So when a parent task ends it must either wait, join, cancel, destroy, track whether there exist any child tasks.
- SL: How to evaluate need for this? What experiment? It would be nice to come up with example to show that if we do have this info available, to track this task all the way, then we can easily compile in this way, and it will be faster/easier.
- LW: One experiment is could we design task local storage? Would it be possible to propose such feature meaningfully? There are requirements, need to know when to create storage, associated malloc storage, and when to destroy it and free that malloc storage.
- SL: I would then say, could we do task local storage as a library or do we need to build it in?
- LW: Good question.
- FMC: I think it's a legitimate question to ask what this concept buys you. But, without prejudice, if you wanted to do task level storage, if we would decide it's really important to do it, then if you simulate it on top of something else that misses the point of having task level storage. It violates the core layering idea that I was going to talk about before. In the design you'd force the concept of task level storage to be in a not natural place than if you did it from the beginning.
- SL: But surely you'd want to have the smallest number of structures.
- FMC: I said assuming we decide it is important, then you'd want to have it in the right place in the overall design. Having the right language to talk about it, it's not about simulation or implementing on top of something else, it's about where does it belong in the stack of designs. Maybe you decide it shouldn't be at the core level, or you may decide it should be more intrinsic. But having that discussion requires the terminology that we understand.
- SL: Yes then you need the semantics of thread or task level storage.
- FMC: Yes, and how it relates to the other things we're trying to do.
