## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

This meeting was [recorded](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/Xi7Abe_UI7rKsJfp2aWArN07sPn8hOeLbv6lfHvlfYbNK5z4t3E2XpvnTZYv6HG2.zLHouWq_BKpwG845?startTime=1649088205000 (Passcode: 6lCscqE%)).

SL: question: is this under the assumption that most code isn’t SS aware? If it were the other way around, would you want to opt-out instead of opt-in?

FM: today you can’t write code that will opt out. I couldn’t enforce any way to have my caller opt out

SL: I guess there are 2 categories [ ? ]. Having to opt-in is more conservative.

[effect type]
AR: I’m not sure I understand the difference to the first approach. If you can just call arbitrary functions… I’m not sure how you can avoid marking every function. It seems like you'd have to track it through the function types

FM: might need to take it offline

End presentation
FM: IMO we need to take care of this problem because it affects the future viability of code written today. ALso it affects the future ecosystem because the people who will have to grapple with this in the future world of lots of interoperable components are least able to.

So 1st question, do we want to do something about this, and if so, what. Do we solve it at the core wasm level or something like a component level.

AR: you started with “what’s good for JS is good for C++”. there’s a dual do that. What’s not bad for JS is not bad for other languages. I.e. it’s an easy trap to just assume that whatever JS has in terms of control is the “natural” thing. Excpetionsa re an example. If you want to interoperate with an EH using language you might assume e.g. whatever you’re calling will return to you. But with EH you might assume some cleanup code will run. But if you donnt have EH it might not. EH is a degenerate form of effect handlers, so it’s a similar problem. We discussed this with EH but you could also discuss with other forms of control flow. E.g. concurrency. If state is mutating concurrently, you get messed up. So it reappears with any form of control flow (code that doesn’t operate how you were expecting gets messed up)

FM: If you are exception awre the sandwich issue won’t effect you, but not aware

AR: yes e.g. if I’m C and I’m sandwiched between a language that throws across me, and bypasses my cleanup code.
So either way your invariants are violated. I think we discussed wrt exceptions and concluded you can’t really guard against in core wasm,you’d need a finegrain effect system that makes everynew form of effect opt-in. On the core wasm level I think we’re accepting there that we have all sorts of effects that could step on you e.g. when you use linear memory to share data. So on this low level tight integration IMO this isn’t a problem we need to or can solve. But on the component boundaries we have interaction between different universes with different assumptions. So it makes sense to try there. It won’t be easy, i’m not sure how.
If the way is static with an effect system, how can you limit it to component boundaries.

FM: currently the idea would be not to have an effect type but strongly limit the possible interactions, dynamically.

AR: that does make sense to me. An exception at the component boundary is basically an uncaught exception  and this would be like an unhanled resume.[
SL: would hti smean adding some functionality to the module/component system. You’d have to specify “this is a component that knows about exceptions”?

AR: no, you don’t allow exceptions to go across boundaries at all

FM: for exceptions. An exception in the callee is mapped to a variant type in the interface, and then remapped to an exception (if applicable) in the caller. So e.g. i fyou’re C calling into C if youre a component, the exception is mapped back to an error type.

RT: does this assume that all languages have an error type like this?

LW: there’s a type in the signature that you can map to an exception or a return value

RT: what is code that wasn’t supposed to throw…

Luke: if you don’t handle if you have an uncaught exception it will trap.

RT: so we have trappging its a commonly agreed upon exception..

LW: more like it ends the world.

[ missed some from SL ] 

LW: future and stream types in IT are like a limited set of effects that limit what you can pass across the boundary

FM: we might need a form of catch_all, 

SL: in typed continuations proposal we have this barrier instruction that catches everything and traps. But in this extension you want to let certain things through because you know how to interpret them on the other side.

LW: right

FM: you’d have patterns that are blessed, eg the streaming pattern. If you want to be able to propagate it out, it would be via such a pattern.

LW: in a month or so Ill present on streams and futures here and in WASI
PP: it looks like there was a presentation [ where? ] on this?

LW: [Aaron? ] gave a high level presentation at the last WASI meeting. It was pretty high level and didn’t have all of the details.

PP: there was an overview of the API. I”ll look in the meetin gnotes.

RT: what about GC languages, which might want tighter integration that components can provide? Will they just have to hope nobody uses stack switching?

FM: GC languages fit into component architecture. Similar situation to non-GC languages, when you convert form one to another it’s a coercion. I don’t think it’s that different.

FT: coercion on all GC boundaries involves lots of wrapping, which doesn’t perform very well. Are we expecting a perf hit for interop?

FM: there is a performance penalty when using components. I don’t think GC makes much difference. It’s the primary arguments for not using IT in components it that it costs too much. For this discussion, this committee would be telling those folks you either want to be able to be safe in which case pay the performanc, or you have to know what you’re doing.

AR: components is based on copying by design, so it doesn’t matter whether its memory or GC.

RT: it sounds like we are saying composability is good and we can support it at components but in cases where we want to pass mutable references with tight integration, we have to give up?

AR: its not different from linear memory when you can’t just pass pointers. If you need that, you have to build tighter integration

LW: also similar to ABIs. if you have a C ABI then everyone intends to follow a single ABI. it’s faster but with shared everything, if you break the rules everything breaks. So you have shared-nothing cross languyage or shared everything and you have to follow the same ABI

RT: … want to import a methods that do the appropriate thing [...[

LW: what ABI are they following? JVM? There’s more to an ABI than just importing the objects and methods

RT: there are conventions e.g. in JS. where you import references and import a JS function that calls a method on the objects. Likewise when you export you decorate it.

LW: so that’s a JS specific ABI that tools can choose to support but it’s not as general

SL: so it’s lowest common denominator, so it seems its inherently poor performance.

LW: yeah when it’s shared nothing you have some cost. Sometimes for immutable cases you can optimize or reduce cost.

RT: so e.g. J2CL, Kotlin, ScalaJS all already use the same JS ABI. so they will be in this situation where you have different GC languages interoping through a JS ABI.

LW: and that’s fine, you can have a JS ABI.

RT: I’m pointing out that you’re saying we should have composability properties for IT but for this ABI

LW:

RT: They use the JS ABI but they aren’t calling into JS directly.

LW: if they go through the speced JS binding, it will enforce this even if it’s wasm->wasm 
RT: It sounds like the answer is that those languages will jstu have to just hope for the best.

FM: to rephrase: we’re telling the developer community that there’s 2 worlds. You know what you’re doing, or you go through the sanitized safe but potentially slow approach with components.
There’s a risk associated which depends on what people do. If theres an ecosystem that’s all based on components, they’ll all just integrate at the component level. If people dont like that penalty (and we’ve heard about that in some cases), then we won’t have a good story for stack switching, since in addition to the copying they also have to be aware of code that will switch underneath them.

FT: you’ll have to wrap every call out with a catch_all and trap and its a question of how expensive are catch_alls and traps going to be.

FM: theres a risk, it’s not really technical, the risk is that we’ll get a perception of being difficult and dangerous to use, like exceptions in C++.  

SL: we have to be careful here. Some calls outside are totally safe, e.g. if you call some mathematical function. You’ll only really have a problem if you passin a callback or something.

FM: that’s true, this is a corner case.

RT: not for OO GC languages, they pass around objects which are effectively callbacks all the time. This will effect viability of the component model for them

SL: yeah if your’e just calling functions e.g. in  math library you’re fine.

FM: if you have 100 foreign modules in your app, you don’t know what the interactions are, it's unreasonable to expect people to know

RT: even the OCaML people are sying they arent just going to allow effects everywhere. Only want it in e.g. system code because they don’t trust users to use them effectively.

SL: that’s a bit misleading. They use their effect handlers such that e.g. an expert implements a library e.g. concurrency, and users of those libraries don’t need to think about them. It will be similar here where you’ll make a library for greenthreads or whatever but most programmers won’t use them. This means they can reasonably get away *without* an effect type system now - though in the future they would definitely like to have one.
