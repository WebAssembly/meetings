## Agenda items

1. Brainstorm: examine [racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/parameterize.html) as a use case for dynamic scoping


## Meeting Notes

Ross presenting slides on racket
Brainstorm ..

Summary: Racket heavily uses multiple forms of dynamic scoping. If racket implemented its features on top of typed continuations there is a risk of some inefficiency. They particularly would need the 1st class label extension.
There are two simple ways of implementing conventional dynamic scoping: managing a global dictionary or passing an extra dynamic doctionary variable in every function. Both approaches have trade offs, but neither requires anything from wasm itself.
Other, more advanced, forms of dynamic scoping imply supporting agressive stack walking in some form. This would require some changes to wasm.
