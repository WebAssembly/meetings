## Agenda items

1. Brainstorm: examine [racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/parameterize.html) as a use case for dynamic scoping


## Meeting Notes

Ross presenting slides on racket
Brainstorm ..

Summary: Racket heavily uses multiple forms of dynamic scoping. If racket implemented its features on top of typed continuations there is a risk of some inefficiency. They particularly would need the 1st class label extension.

There are two known ways of implementing conventional dynamic scoping: managing a global dictionary or passing an extra dynamic doctionary variable in every function. Both approaches have trade offs, but neither requires anything from wasm itself.
Other, more advanced, forms of dynamic scoping imply supporting agressive stack walking in some form. This would require some changes to wasm.

AR: Maintaining dynamic scope by managing a global dictionary is complicated, brittle, and costly. The parameter solution is simpler but induces a global extra cost for every function call, so is not pay-as-you-go.

For the same reasons, there is no "zero-cost" implementation of dynamic scoping in the presence of non-local control. Even as an extra Wasm feature it would generally be linear.

The only way to achieve zero overhead for dynamic scoping in the context of the control abstractions we are interested in for this proposal is by making the dynamic scoping already inherent in stack switching accessible to the program, which at least avoids paying two costs.
