[AZ presenting slides.  Notes omitted when they match text on slides]

[Slide 2]

WASM has had synchronous code since 2015.

[Slide 6]

Limitations since 2015

[Slide 8]

4 APIs calls for Asyncify

Start_unwind
`stop_unwind`
`start_rewind`
`stop_rewind`

Necessary in MVP. More recently could have used multi-memory or allocating multiple arrays.

[Slide 10]

Example does a sleep operation.  Global is checked at the beginning because the $sleep function will be re-entered on rewind.

[Slide 11]

FM: In JS promise integration if we call an import that returns a promise, your sleep function would call an external function that returns a Promise.  Then a version of the Promise is returned from $main.

AZ: We would not have the function $sleep. We would call an imported function. The runtime code would need to be in the JS side to resolve the Promise.  The code on the slide is pure WASM.

FM: You want to return from the sleepified function you need to re-enter the code.  We can take this offline.

SL: There are two calls to $main.  The first prints 1 and returns.  The second call to $main is called after the $sleep?

AZ: Exactly right.

SL: Thanks!

[Slide 12]

50% code size and speed downside.  Is acceptable for some use cases.


[Slide 13]

Asyncify does not do CPS-style transformation.  This made sense in MVP. Today with tailcalls, indirect calls may be cheaper.

[Slide 16]

Fade effects in DOOM 3 render in a loop outside of the main loop.  It is not easy to refactor. Just add a sleep there.

[Slide 19]

Asyncify originally for async/await, but now for setjmp/longjmp.

[Slide 22]
Emscripten used LLVM to transform and then JS for unwinding, but did not work in WASI that only has WASM

[Slide 23]

Ruby is using asyncify for setjmp/longjmp in WASI

[Slide 25]

Game, TinyGo, and Ruby use with 50% overhead shows the need for stackswitching.

[Slide 27]

LW: Does Ruby need conservative stack scanning.
AZ: I only know what people told me.  I did not read the code.

[Slide 28]

Asyncify API is minimal

[Slide 29]

Could stackswitching API be simple?

[Slide 30]

FM: Does it handle multiple pauses?
AZ: When you pause, it stores the position in the function.  You can swap between the stacks at runtime.

FM: Where does the 50% overhead come from?
AZ: I’d have to look at the JIT code emitted.  Register pressure seems to be because of the serialize and deserialize at the start and end of the function that keeps all the locals alive.

SL: The 50% is in the amount of code?
AZ: 50% larger and 50% slower

SL: Sounds like “Continuations from generalized stack-inspection” (https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pcmkf-cont-from-gen-stack-insp/paper.pdf)

[Also see Florian Loitsch’s work on implementing this idea in JavaScript using exceptions: https://florian.loitsch.com/publications - “Exceptional Continuations in JavaScript” + his PhD thesis]

AZ: I have never heard of that paper.
SL: In order to suspend and resume you annotate your functions.  Labeled switch statements and raise exceptions.  Sound like the same idea.
AZ: Labeled switch makes me think every statement turned into a big switch, but asyncify preserves ifs and loops.  Do they preserve loops?
SL: Yes. Includes generalization like call/cc.  It is fully general?
AZ: It seems so.  Once you can have multiple stacks and resume you can do all this.
SL: You could implement backtracking.  It’s a scary thing.
AZ: Yeah, you can get it wrong.


FM: How many instructions does a stack switch cost?  It is the depth.  For generators it is very swallow. For a yield style generator it’s not a deep tree.  You’re iterating over an array.  The call stack is quite shallow.  In that scenario, is there zero or almost zero overhead?
AZ: Yeah, but it is both how shallow and how much code that needs to be skipped over.
AR: Number of locals you need to restore.
DS: The number of calls that don’t need to be instrumented like indirect calls in C++ that can’t be proved to not be paused.

FM: For setjmp/longjmp you don’t know what functions will be called.
AZ: In LLVM we cheat.  We only let longjmp be called statically.  We don’t allow using a function pointer.  We haven’t found a program where this is a problem.
FM: That’s smart.
AZ: It’s more than the spec allows, but it works.
FM Like how eval in JS works differently when called indirectly.

FM: Can you see that you would do to asyncify to improve it?
AZ: We have a list of ideas to improve the optimizer around asyncify.  Asyncify assumes that we save the locals in one location, but having multiple sets would increase code size.  As the code gets around 50% we decided not to do this work and hope stack switching would do this.

FM: There’s a fiber API?
AZ: In emscripten using JS and the Asyncify API.

FM: Benefit you get with asyncify you can bypass WASM restriction of accessing your locals.  How important is this?
AZ: Are you asking about users?
DS: How many actually access the locals?
FM: Yeah.
DS: Emscripten it is a side-effect.  An implementation detail unless they’ve reverse engineered.
AZ: Probably not. We have scan_registers in Emscripten.  The Ruby VM does use it. [EI Ruby VM patch appears to be https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18462, which was opened 11 days ago].

AR: Not accessing WASM locals is a security concern.  Everything is in linear memory and anyone can smash stack frames. Can anything be done to make this more secure?
AZ: Could be misused.  Anyone shipping own code it’s fine.
AR: They could modify too.
DS: Depends on security model. Registers are to protect the VM.  If you can transform a WASM modules and get someone to execute it.

FM: Has anyone used Asyncify for a source-level debugger?
AZ: Not that I know.  We would need to emit a mapping.
FM: If you have a language-specific toolchain with its own debugger it could do it itself.

LH: You don’t pay attention to liveness.  You save all of them?
AZ: If it is alive at least one pause point, but a lot aren’t.

EI: Shadow stack means we have the locals exposed already.
FM: Yeah
DS: Yeah, not just for stack switching. Also for address of variables in C++.
