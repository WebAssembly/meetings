### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

TM Presenting ([slides](TODO))

TL (chat): Are there any valid values for “promising” other than “first”?

BD (chat): ‘last’ and ‘none’, but i think we only support ‘first’ right now.

TL: For the promise rejection demo, does the exception propagating through the Wasm stack have an exception tag or can it only be caught with catch_all?

TM: It is a normal JS exception, so there is no exception tag.

TL: To clarify, JSPI will switch before stack switching, so Prompt2 won’t be able to exist and JSPI will always return to Prompt1 back at JS?

FM: Don’t know shipping order precisely, but essentially yes. Also looking to possibly refactor the JS interface to disentangle from the type reflection proposal.

SL: Past performance concerns?

FM: We were previously not measuring the right thing. Haven’t redone performance measurements with the current version, but we don’t anticipate any difference. Function call is about 6ns, calling into JS is 12-15ns, with a promise is 20ns. Constant with depth of computation. (Numbers from memory)

TM: In most cases there are no regressions for existing code. Exception is going from Wasm to JS. Need to check for existence of JS frames on stack.

FM: Supporting large numbers of stacks may come with additional overhead, for example to take an additional mutex. Also still trying to figure out whether we can call Web APIs on the arbitrary current stack and we may have to change that. We don’t want to have to switch to a main stack, but there are large engineering challenges.

TL: What would force us to not call Web APIs on the arbitrary current stack?

FM: There’s no stack checking.

TL: Does the browser currently do stack checking on the main stack?

FM: No.
