## Meeting Notes

SL: Also looking forward to Daniel and Luna’s work on an implementation in Wasmtime and getting performance feedback from them.

FM: I don’t disagree. Luna is presenting next month. We do need to go fast because Kotlin and Dart are making business decisions about whether to use core stack switching maybe within the next 6 months. Don’t want to spend too much time experimenting.

TL: I’m looking forward to getting the production JSPI implementation in V8 so we can experiment with different core stack switching “front ends” on top of that in a real production environment. Demonstrating progress is almost as important as actually finishing.

FM: What kind of presentations do we want next year?

TL: I’d like to see more design space explorations like we had at the F2F meeting. It would be good to get everyone to understand all the pros and cons of different designs to understand where each other is coming from, even if we don’t agree.

BT: I’d like to zoom in and see implementation-level details for different designs.

SL: Will you be able to implement it in Wizard?

BT: Yes, probably this summer.

TL: I’d also like to get a Binaryen implementation in place so Dart and Kotlin can experiment with it.

SL: Do Dart and Kotlin depend on Binaryen?

TL: For their optimizations, yes.

FM: Dart is using JSPI for generators and async functions. Would be good to get them using a Wasm-only library that “implements” JSPI without promises.

SL: OCaml 5 has full stack switching with no new language constructs, just an API. It’s a little clunky to use, but that’s deliberate to allow future flexibility to design new language primitives for it. Not sure how that translates to WebAssembly. Could we spec an API? Not sure how to think about the trade off between new instructions and new APIs.

TL: Downside of specifying instructions is that it takes forever and requires consensus, etc. Downside of specifying an API is that it’s not possible because there’s no process for that. The closest thing is WASI, which doesn’t exist in browsers.

BT: Also, new control flow needs new instructions because you can’t pass labels via APIs.

SL: Sounds like the API isn’t worth exploring.

BT: Implementing an API doesn’t require anything new in the engine, so it’s not useful for learning anything.

FM: On the other hand, JSPI does require changes in the engine.
