## Agenda items

1. [Effect handlers in C++](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/1e594b8db8238b851c6afb3e057aeb6d99224323/stack/2022/presentations/wasm-eff-slides.pdf) (Maciej Piróg)

   In this talk, I'll discuss the design of a C++ library for (one-shot) effect handlers built on top of a simple stack-switching mechanism. The library is type-safe, has a readable API, and the performance doesn't seem to be a dealbreaker. While it is *just* a library, I'll focus on the aspects that might be relevant to compilation of native effect handlers, such as memory management and dealing with value types.

## Meeting Notes

This meeting was [recorded](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/QRiZoozn9Ma4b5xKVK9aIKt6mLs5Mhw2GSRqD1WLTK66QafNW4f1Mp6PT1XqDjff.0CqqILEIcTdCvXf7).

MP: Developed in conjunction with Huawei research in Edinburgh and others including Sam LIndley.
MP: C++ library with one shot handlers on top of boost.context
MP: Boost.context is inconvenient to use directly.
MP: Make concurrency easier to use in C++ including type safety and expressiveness.
MP: Needs to be composable
MP: Are effect handlers C++ friendly? How idiomatic are they. How expressive. Can we get needed performance?

MP: Not the first attempt
MP: “Jeff: Objects for effect”, “Effect Handlers for the masses” two previous papers.
MP: C++ different programming model. Value types, no GC, no parametric polymorphism, move semantics. Templates. 
MP: One-shot semantics is a good fit with C++
MP: Handlers in C++ is different to Java and to C. 
MP: Looking for a higher-level abstraction.

MP: Elegant programmer interface
MP: Type safety. Operations are typed.
MP: Performance.

MP: API:
Two commands: Yield & Fork
Functions: yield, fork.

MP: Commands correspond to operations in effect terminology.
MP: Each handler handles a number of commands.
AR: What is the empty struct
MP: That is ugly C++. You have to construct ‘what you inherit from’.

MP: Defining a handler.
MP: You need to define a new class. Handlers look like objects.
MP: Example inherits from FlatHandler because the return clause is trivial.
MP: Overwrite functions that are the Commands. (Implement the operations)
MP: In this library, you override the CommandClause function with different Command arguments.
MP: C++ trivia: if you omit the variable name then that argument is not used (and you can avoid an unused argument warning)

MP: We actually have a scheduler loop in the green threads implementation.
MP: Code is available on github

MP: Object state and behavior. Here they also encapsulate control.
MP: EH are known to be expressive but safety is important.
MP: Type safety of commands and resumptions. 
MP: Effects encapsulated by handlers.
MP: Don’t have to worry about lifetimes. Library takes care of resumptions.
MP: Modern C++ have move semantics for managing resumptions which is very useful for one-shot resumptions.

FM: What happens when you nest handlers.
MP: Innermost handler is the default. You can have labels and you refer to specific handlers when you invoke a command.

MP: Implementation
Stack of metaframes, each references a Boost fiber. 

MP: invoking a command. We use C++ virtual dispatch + multiple inheritance. Dynamic cast is pretty expensive.

MP: Memory management of handlers. 
MP: handlers are created when we handle a computation.
MP: Created when we call OneShot::Handle. 
MP: When should it be deleted?
MP: Deleted after resumptions are deleted and the return clause invoked.
MP: All possible resumptions are preallocated. That leads to a nasty pointer/stack cycle.
MP: No TCO in C++, which can lead to stack overflow. Separate mechanism needed to deal with this.
MP: Programming with handlers and value types: can’t define polymorphic operations needed for exceptions or async/await.

MP: Performance. Depends on Boost performance.
MP: Stack of abstraction is quite tall.
MP: Prefer elegant API.

MP: Benchmark. Traversing a tree. Effect handlers better than C++ native coroutines worse than pure recursive descent.

RT: You are using Boost. What would it take to port to WebAssembly?
MP: Boost has a simple API: suspend and resume fiber. 
MP: It would be good to have a data pipe between fibers: create, resume, checking the state of the fiber. Compare two fibers.
MP: No fancy machinery except for move semantics.

SL: If you had an interface closer to the effect handlers you needed it might have been easier; especially wrt dynamic casting and multiple inheritance.
MP: In many cases, you can use labels to avoid dynamic casts.
MP: I wanted to use the simplest library. Allows for easier portability.

FM: Did you integrate with exception handling?
MP: No, but it should be straightforward with the boost library.
MP: Boost allows you to throw exceptions to fibers.
MP: Not sure what the semantics should be.
