## Participants


## Agenda items

1. Review of 'issues' raised during core stack switching discussion in F2F.

This list is transcribed from the meeting notes. 

   * Unothodox entry points
   * dispatches everywhere (are type checks & dispatches equivalent?)
   * mechanisms for suspension (computation vs message passing/checks for special cases)
   * is handler lookup dynamic scoping
   * what types of suspension patterns are legal? What types of systems use them
   * can we make native switch work? Is is a good solution?
   * implementation techniques for dynamic scoping
   * funneling references vs accidental capture
   * do fibers allow heap cycles
   * are cycles/mutale references required?
   * how much of a concern is memory management to engines?
   * what representative use cases are addressed by each proposal which are not addressed by the other
   * implicit overheads of both proposals

We will triage this list, possibly adding new issues and concerns.
