## Agenda items

1. Review of 'issues' raised during core stack switching discussion in F2F.

This list is transcribed from the meeting notes. 

   * Should we disallow unorthodox entry points to functions?
   * When should we dispatch - suspend/resume/switch event? 
   * Are type checks & dispatches equivalent? (Semantic+Performance implications)
   * What is the role & scope of type checking in stack switching? (Single type of whole computation, multiple types over a computation, effect types)
   * Suspend/resume regime vs switch-only regime for switching computation.
   * Should switching be entangled with communication?
   * What are the implications of dynamic scoping for semantics + performance?
   * What are the tolerable costs of validation for switching?
   * Should the machine enforce structured concurrency?
   * What safety guarantees do we want the machine to enforce? (Intra and inter-module/component)
   * What are the appropriate implementation techniques for dynamic scoping
   * Should the machine support general dynamic scoping?
   * Should stack switching depend on dynamic scoping?
   * funneling references vs accidental capture
   * Do fibers allow heap cycles
   * Are cycles/mutable references required?
   * How much of a concern is memory management to engines? (Do we depend on WasmGC? Do we allow languages to not depend on WasmGC?)
   * Should an unreachable computation be allowed to be garbage collected?
   * What representative use cases are addressed by each proposal which are not addressed by the other?
   * Who are the important stakeholders in the design of wasm stack switching?
   * How can we determine the performance overheads of any given proposal?
   * What kind of experiments are required to compare designs?

We will triage this list, possibly adding new issues and concerns.

## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

FM: Would like to triage issue list, figure out what we can remove, what we would like to add.

SL: I have questions about what some of the points mean.

### Discussion: Issues from F2F meeting

FM: Any burning points to raise?

TL: I liked Andreas’s presentation of the design space. It confirmed my belief that the existing fibers and typed continuation proposals are very similar. They are different points in the design space of delimited continuations.

FM: Agree.

#### Unorthodox entry points

FM: Refers to the part of the fibers proposal where a fiber starts in a suspended state and is available to receive events.

RH: As an implementer, these might be tricky to implement.

TL: This seems like a niche issue, since it’s only a problem for specific designs. Not sure it’s worth discussing before we have a big picture.

SL: Could rephrase as “should we disallow the design from having unorthodox entry points.”

FM: Agree. Moving on.

#### dispatches everywhere?

RH: Not clear what context this is for. As a comparison between proposals or divorced from any proposal at all?

SL: Was this arising from the distinction between the typed continuations proposal, where there is only dispatch on suspend, and the fibers proposals where there is a dispatch on resumes as well.

FM: Yes, that’s where “everywhere” comes from.

TL: To use Sam’s previous framing, we can answer “should we disallow designs that dispatch in both directions?” and I think the answer is no. We should at least be open to considering both options here.

#### Are type checks & dispatches equivalent?

FM: I think we can leave this question. There is clearly confusion here.

SL: Was this arising from the idea of dynamic typing via dispatch?

TL: Right, came up again due to dispatch on resume direction. Would be happy to leave this question because we can easily measure the performance impact once we have implementations.

SL: Could consider performance and semantic differences separately.

RH: There were lots of options for how to type transmitted values. Does the type change over the lifetime of the stack resource?

SL: This is also equivalent to whether event tags for suspensions have return types.

TL: Again, I think we should not close the door on either option here. Can guide the decision by producer ergonomics and performance. Tied into previous discussion.

FM: There are also questions about what Wasm types are for.

#### mechanisms for suspension (computation vs message passing/checks for special cases)

FM: Not sure what this is about.

DG: Sorry for hastily scribbled items. We should prioritize them and choose the most important.

RT: I think this is about how control is resumed.

SL: What was the part about checks for special cases?

RT: I don’t know.

FM: We can replace this with something that makes more sense. I would rephrase this as “Suspend/resume regime vs switch-only regime for switching computation.”

SL: You can have combinations of those.

FM: Another missing dimension… “Should switching be entangled with communication?”

TL: Can you give examples?

FM: Goroutines switch control but do not handle communications.

SL: Wasmtime fibers is another example that don’t involve communication. Both current designs do entangle them. Java 19 as well.

FM: When talking to John McCall, he said they would like to separate them out.

#### Is handler lookup dynamic scoping?

RH: What’s unclear to me, is what positive or negative answers to this question would mean for the design and implementation.

SL: When Andreas gave his talk, he gave a version of the design space where you search by the name of a tag, and that’s a dynamic search. He also argued that if you search by the name of a handler, it’s also dynamic.

RT: Don’t think so. He was asserting that validation through a search was the same was dynamic scoping.

TL: Andreas isn’t here to clarify what he meant. Without a precise statement to discuss, not sure we can have a useful conversation here.

RT: Does a transfer uniquely specify a target or not? Are there multiple candidates with some policy to determine which to use? Is there meta-state you need to rely on to determine whether you’re allowed to transfer.

SL: There’s one question of whether the target is uniquely determined. That’s separate from whether determining it requires a dynamic search.

RT: Right, it’s about whether validation requires search.

TL: Validation in the Wasm sense?

RT: No, validation that a transfer is valid and allowed at runtime.

FM: There’s how to do the validation and there’s the performance of validation.

SL: And also the uniqueness of the target.

FM: Dynamic scoping to me means there is a search for the target. The target changes depending on the dynamic context you’re in.

RT: How much context is necessary to determine where you jump to and to determine whether it’s a valid jump.

SL: Lots of different options from Andreas’s slides.

TL: Ross, you said in the meeting that you had a solution that didn’t involve any linear time components. It would be great to get a writeup of that offline.

RT: There is a discussion of switching already with no follow-up. Direct switching is how you get constant time performance.

TL: Sounds right at a high level, but devil is in the details. It would be good to see a complete writeup of how the whole system avoids linear cost.

RT: Can do that, but don’t want folks to immediately say we don’t want to that for unrelated reasons.

... Note taker lost internet ...

#### funneling references vs accidental capture

SL: Claim that you run into the same issue by other means.

FM: Let’s leave it, don’t want to discuss right now.

#### GC questions

FM: Let’s leave this for now.

TL: I think we can definitely say that depending on GC for the full design is fine, because we can always support consumers that don’t want to implement GC via an analogue to MVP Wasm’s indirect function table.

FM: Let’s leave this for now.

#### What representative use cases are addressed by each proposal which are not addressed by the other?

FM: Good questions. Will add “Who are the important stakeholders in the design of wasm stack switching?” Language and engine implementers.

SL: Also application developers

FM: Also end users.

FM: Will also add “How can we determine the performance overheads of any given proposal?”

RT: We know the context switch, however it is represented, is the most expensive operation. So we want to make it so that our proposal doesn’t require any more context switches than a native implementation would.

RT: A lot of these languages already have implementations, so we can count the context switches.

SL: Surely what matters is time, not number of context switches. In a lot of applications, it’s not clear that minimizing context switches has a huge impact. Multicore OCaml is competitive with Rust or Go, but is based on a design where it suspends and resumes to switch, so it does twice as many switches. So there is a real-world counterexample to what you’re saying is obvious.

RT: We’ve also heard from teams for which reducing the number of switches was an important and noticeable optimization.

FM: Want to lift up from the details of this question. This can be folded into whatever experiments we end up doing. Some experiments will show a difference and others won’t.

SL: My concern is premature optimization.

FM: We’re at time, but is there anything obviously missing from the list?

SL: It’s quite sprawling. Maybe we should try triaging it.

RH: If we posted discussion topics on each of these, most of them would not get discussed.

FM: Will post discussions in GitHub and see how things go. Will bring these back for discussion in future meetings as well. Will have to take holidays, etc. into account in the near future.
