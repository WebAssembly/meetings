## Agenda items

1. Brainstorm: examine [greenlets](https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet) as a use case for stack switching


## Meeting Notes

Ross introduces the use case using [slides](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/stack/2022/presentations/2022-11-21-tate-python-greenlets.pdf)

FM: You can’t move greenlets between threads?

RT: That’s what it looks like. Because they assume that C stack frames can’t be moved between threads.

TL: Are “threads” real threads?

RT: yes

TL: Are they python threads with the global interpreter lock?

RT: Yes, I think so.

FM: Does target.switch have a return value?

RT: Yes. Same with target.throw.

DH: Is the parent controlled by the library or user code?

RT: The C++ runtime code sets it up for you.

DH: What about the finalizers? Do they run non-deterministically?

RT: Yes. And all the stuff about the dead greenlets is also implemented in C++ as well.

FM: Do you happen to know if libraries are relying on this pass-through for switching to dead greenlets?

RT: I do not know how much they rely on any one of the individual features. I suspect that the better documented features are the ones that are used. This one was explicitly documented.

FM: It’s kind of bizarre.

RT: I guess it works for them. Since greenlets form trees, you have to consider where control goes if a child or parent is dead. Maybe that led to this design.

FM: We have to be careful. This is what people are doing, whether or not it’s a good idea.

TL: I think this could be implemented on top of any design we’ve discussed so far. With stack switching, obviously greenlet switching could use the direct switching. With delimited continuations, would have a broker thread with children for each greenlet. Incidentally, this is the same pattern Emscripten uses to spawn new threads, so I think it’s common. No matter what design we use, there will be user-level data structures representing all the Python data structures. The WebAssembly design only affects the handwritten Wasm that implements the switch itself.

FM: Even with direct switching, you can’t use the Wasm design directly because of the dead greenlet semantics.

TL: Right, those would be represented by the in-memory Python objects that haven’t been garbage collected yet. Python-on-Wasm is implemented by compiling CPython with Emscripten, so you could link the switching code directly into the Emscripten program.

TL: To generalize, we have to lower all sorts of different source semantics to Wasm. We shouldn’t aim to encode any particular language directly in Wasm. If there is some “emulation” and user-level coordination, that’s working as expected.

FM: Want to push back on that. If you’re trying to lower your language, you’ll do progressive lowering of your semantics. At some point they hit metal, i.e. WebAssembly or ARM, etc. Ideally what we want then is the ideal instruction at that point in the lowering. Our task is to meet them there.

TL: Runtime libraries are codeveloped with compilers, so it’s ok if lowering bottoms out as a call to runtime functionality rather than a single instruction.

RT: For the greenlets library, that runtime code for switching cannot be directly translated to WebAssembly because it assumes that stack state is available in linear memory. You have to change more code for porting to Wasm than for porting to other normal ISAs.

FM: The cutoff point for the platform-specific code is different for Wasm. The lower that point is, the closer it is to a normal ISA, the better. If you impose policy on the engine, that’s going to affect this porting process, so there had better be a good reason for that policy, e.g. soundness and safety. The higher-level the design, the higher up the compiler stack (including runtime library) you end up having to refactor.

RT: The more you put into the engine, the more you have to refactor the compiler/runtime code.

RT: It sounds like we’re all on the same page that to make greenlets work, 1) we don’t want to make greenlet semantics the same as Wasm semantics, 2) most of the C++ for greenlets would stay the same, 3) some of it would have to be translated to Wasm, and that might be more than for other ISA, and 4) they would have to emulate direct switching on top of whatever the WebAssembly design is.

RT: Hypothetically, we could consider adding a “change parent” instruction to the existing fibers proposal, but then we’d have to consider dead greenlets and all that would become our problem.

TL: Exactly, and the simplifying assumption is that there is a robust userspace layer keeping track of all that, so we don’t need to worry about it. Agree with everything you said before.

DH: I still don’t understand what it even means to change the parent.

RT: (explanation of greenlets semantics)

FM: It’s kind of an extreme, isn’t it? Does anyone know of any other system with this much mutability?

RT: I suspect that the way a lot of this is getting used is in ways Daniel was just describing. It’s not the library’s job to maintain these bigger invariants. The library just makes sure we can switch to things reliably.

DH: Do we know of concrete use cases for all this extra functionality?

RT: Not sure.

FM: I hope the greenlet author will come talk to us. Even if they do all reimplement the same structure on top of it, it would be much easier to bring the Python ecosystem to Wasm if we actually supported the full semantics of the library rather than something very different.

RT: Knowing a convention exists doesn’t help unless you know the entire ecosystem follows that convention with no exceptions.

FM: If you don’t support the full greenlets semantics, you get 180k porting projects instead of 1 porting project.

DH: I don’t think there’s a world where you can’t implement greenlets on top of Wasm, so that’s good.

FM: The big risk is making things more complicated for library/runtime authors.
