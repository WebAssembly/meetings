## Meeting Notes

### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

[Meeting recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/IE-YHBX66B7u-hWD8Omjrp7bkrjFhlM03UVZzq0Qt11BV9gVBvt9hr7fHFE2s0K4.2CBqNwEwAmKXCkt5) available.

SL: Who does the fusing of the lifting & lowering adapters
LW: This code would be generated during an additional compilation step, which can be seen as part of module linking.

AR: Future<String> did not have an explicit length param in the canonical ABI
LW: The resizing of the string is done automatically using realloc.

AR: All the core signatures use i32 which is a kind of void pointer. Do you imagine some better annotations?
LW: The documentation is primarily coming from the interface type layers.
