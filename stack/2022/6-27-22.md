## Agenda items

1. Continued discussion on task-based stack switching. (AMA)

## Meeting Notes

Fgm gave a rerun of previous presentation on task based stack switching.
There was some discussion about how erlang would integrate. PS expressed a concern that, since there is no stack walking in this proposal, Erlang implementations would still need to use a shadow stack to enable support for GC.
PP expressed some concerns about stack management as it relates to having many threads.
