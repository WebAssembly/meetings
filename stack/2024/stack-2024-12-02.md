## Discussion

The recording of this meeting is available [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/XTMerVeM5KvHwy9xw4vMb-lZOERy3SnCy3oltvzHcwcQgNQfCBFo_RWKtfjRGbSx.w2Hf_lqSzMbP3-ML?startTime=1733159093000).

The history of the structure of JSPI was introduced. Arguments were heard from Kevin Gibbons, Shu-yu Guo and others.

The issue was reduced to a choice: to specify that the return value from a Suspending function be passed to Promise.resolve (which has the effect of converting Promise-like objects to Promises as well as ensuring that all suspensions will involve a trip through the micro-task runner) or to replace the existing predicate with one that mimics the test specified for Promise.resolve (and to invoke Promise.resolve on values that pass that test), but to otherwise return the value to the WebAssembly caller.

Resolution will follow additional discussions with key stakeholders.
