### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

RT: The reason they do the list thing is that the thing you just described is inefficient. If you have to eagerly construct the list every time you add a stack trace frame, that's inefficient.

FM: Agree. Will address later.

BT: Would the list be allocated on the heap?

FM: Many ways to do it. Could have an array.

BT: Languages expect stack traces to be zero-cost.

FM: Right, I wouldn't recommend one actually do this, but they could.


BT: I've been thinking about how to implement dynamic scope quickly. It seems you would want a head for each tag, so switching stacks would have cost linear in the number of tags.

TL: If you use an indirection like storing all the heads in a list, then you can just switch a single pointer to the list when switching stacks.

BT: Would want to have a list with only the modified tags to avoid having grow with number of tags in the system.

TL: No way to statically know what tags will be modified.

RT: Do we need switch-with-unlink?

FM: No, that's normal switching.

…

FM: Oh, you're right, we need switch.unlink.

AR: You would also have to walk the stack on a normal switch.

FM: Maybe, yeah.

BT: Mutability of dynamic scopes is helpful. I wonder if that makes anything easier with the internal bookkeeping. Would be good to be able to support mutability in the future.

SL: Daniel Hillerström pointed out to me immediately before this meeting that an ICFP 2006 paper on Delimited Dynamic Binding: https://okmij.org/ftp/papers/DDBinding.pdf is likely very relevant to the kind of discussion we had here (particularly the part presented by TL)
