### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

This meeting was recorded. The recording can be accessed [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/XETXlK2U2eF8p2kVe-SKgTuxz_FT00zYL9X1o548ZxIA76pMqDkCVJq5bDI5yVkd.kDAx8J05R6-Sbsqb)

Sam explains the explainer

Ben: IIRC switch is a desugaring; does it make sense to show it if that is that case?

Sam: see the task scheduling example. (In short, it is not exactly a desugaring of resume/suspend.)

Yury Delendik (chat):
Can you cover interaction with "foreign" frames (e.g. imports calls to javascript/host functions) and re-entrance?

FM: it’s hard to allow host frames to be suspended

CW: if a suspend signal in Wasm hits a JS frame, there’s a trap

FM: question about whether we can describe JSPI in terms of stack switching

TL: we should add a sketch of modifications to embedder API - hitting a JS frame should trap but we’ve not tried to spec this yet

CW: should work like exceptions in JS-API

FM: need to extend embedder appendix and JS-API (two separate issues)

SL: still questions to resolve in phase 2 - cont.bind discussion (like func.bind)

CW: also barrier instruction discussion - either on resume or as lexically scoped block

SL: yes

SL: also discussion on type parameters for switch - second continuation type technically derivable from the first

FM: this vote is on a recommendation to the Wasm CG

POLL: “We recommend the wasm CG to adopt this proposal as a phase 2 proposal”

SF: 11
F: 3
N: 0
A: 0
SA: 0

poll passes

FM: will probably skip next meeting - when we get back should go through remaining issues

SL+FM: should make sure to have meeting 4 weeks from now on these issues

FM: extending the embedder API may not be obvious
