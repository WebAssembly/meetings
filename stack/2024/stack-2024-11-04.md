## Agenda items

1. Discuss issue #29 (or a variant of it: should we throw instead of trapping?) (Francis McCabe)
1. Discussion around bringing JSPI to phase 4. (Francis McCabe)

## Discussion

This meeting was recorded. The recording can be accessed [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/j2NJbpi_c2B9mUZXvGq_923z7nrxu65J61ml3zNj5a-8sQJCGR-6nqF3kJqCctKW.bVwbSKb6K5_0yqlD)

It was agreed that an exception should be generated instead of trapping – when a JSPI assertion is invalidated: i.e., when trying to suspend a computation with JS Frames on the stack.

There was some discussion about which exception to throw. It was felt that a WebAssembly.RuntimeError may not be appropriate since that exception was associated with traps: it is the exception that is thrown to JS when wasm traps.

FGM presented highlights of the js-api specification – which included some details about how JSPI’s specification is structured.

There was no vote on moving to phase 4 at this meeting. It will be brought up again in 4 weeks; when hopefully all remaining issues will have been resolved.
