### Adoption of the agenda

### Discussion

This meeting was recorded. Recording can be accessed [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/Jhqn61ZS5dJsZiSoy18P-OAp6MS4a1vyQOa0mKrkqieFNRd1YJ7WlpUVzFkkj65T.4_QMlfvhjxC7nkuf).

#### cont.bind
FM: not much to say yet, Frank will present later
CW: from that issue, seems we went back to left-to-right binding and TL is ok with it saying for now

#### test suite
AR: like EH, bad coverage, need good test suite
FM: we need cohesive thinking on tst suite contents, JSPI test suite same concerns, V8 has tests but specific to V8 internals. Same true for EH?
TL: need spec coverage at minimum (per-rule/condition)
FM: can we run the spec?
SL: yes!
DH: most tests are for validation, others are ad-hoc (reference interpreter)
FM: personally I’d prefer a proof over a test
SL: can spectec do coverage?
AR: we’ve talked about it - quick to build?
CW: get coverage of reference interpreter directly
AR: maybe
SL: orthogonal to stack switching?
SL: clear we want more tests
FM: connection to benchmarks

#### barrier instruction
FM: what do people think?
CW: mandatory for shared-everything-threads, defer to that?
SL: agree strongly - want to defer
FM: I care about interoperation across modules - stack switching aware compose with not aware. Barrier is messy. Ecosystem-level motivation.
SL: your preferred solution?
FM: some kind of suspendable annotation like shared
AR: we added it during an early discussion - it’s interesting because it’s the missing piece that lets you self-host. Not immediate concern.
LW: jco-transpile turns adaptors into core-wasm - we want a catch-all for suspend signals
CW: call-level ok?
LW: yes
FM: close for now but keep requirements in mind?
SL: currently in reference interpreter
FM: reference interpreter should reflect consensus
AR: LW wants to generate it?
LW: whenever stack-switching is shipped
TL: browser can polyfill with a noop JS wrapper (sad!)
LW: would push to add it back later
SL: seems we need the functionality
CW: make sure people don’t prototype wrong thing
FM: schedule for future meeting

#### embedding API changes
TL: need to update embedder spec

#### heavily-nested scenarios
LW: request that before we’re done, test heavily nested scenarios and come up with a plan (document predictable optimisation?) - switch makes optimisations nicer but what is heuristic signal?
TL: talked to Kotlin folks - does every coroutine need a suspend? Seems only needed at the boundary from normal->coroutine. With interleaving you can get a lot of frames, but not in the normal case.
ZB: currently we don’t plan to use suspend on every call - on first suspend call we mark, when we get to suspend point we call a function to set that up. Should be lightweight.
TL: so you try to call in normally, and only if it actually suspends try to fix it up
ZB: yes
TL: mismatch with our language features - need a static handler - would this be an engine optimisation?
FM: connected to my idea of call-on-new-stack
CW: ZB, how would map to our instructions?
ZB: we looked at current stack-switching instructions, we can be flexible, seems it should be lightweight
SL: we need to experiment! what’s the timeline? What does Kotlin need?
ZB: we need GC + stack switching
SL: wasmtime has basic support
ZB: close to finishing? 6-7 instructions left. Plausible we can experiment soon
SL: this year?
ZB: end-this year, start-next year
FM: wasmtime really support GC?
DH: plan is yes, with pluggable GCs starting with noop
FM: Kotlin needs real GC for nontrivial examples
FM: stack switching in component model - streaming interface?
LW: could show up in core wasm - and in interface even if not used in core Wasm (asynchronous lifting/lowering could get compiled to stack switching)
FM: applications using streaming?
LW: experimental work right now - lots of interest - within a year. We shouldn’t forget Go wants stack switching for its runtime - compositionality stress test.
FM: another source of stress tests
LW: jco-transpile can emit soon

#### subtyping
TL: how would cast work
AR: it will fail at runtime
CW: cast from abs to concrete?
AR: fails at runtime - fits spec
FM: rtt in code stream?
BT: seems tough for non-GC implementations
TL: we expect heap types to be castable - binaryen has assumptions - inserts casts we know will succeed
BT: if you need to cast, box in a struct
CW: struct lets you cast abs to concrete?
AR: yes - struct lets you piggy-back

#### repo process
FM: we need a single branch that represents the current working state - how are changes made? Want reviews.
SL: when we had 2 different designs, we worked on separate branches (and some even in separate repo)
FM: need extra pairs of eyes - whose eyes? Need more reviewers. How?
SL: we have reference interpreter PR
FM: need 3 PRs - wasm 3.0 PR, wasmfx PR, switch PR
SL: a lot of work
AR: do wasm 3.0 merge first - make diff smaller, then split interpreter and doc PR
CW: shouldn’t need to separate the interpreter switch patch
AR: yeah, can just review interpreter PR
CW: any non-intepreter stuff above 3.0?
SL: just reference interpreter
AR: tests?
SL: in reference interpreter

#### Generative tags
Deferred to a follow-up meeting.

next meeting (in 2 weeks) cancelled
