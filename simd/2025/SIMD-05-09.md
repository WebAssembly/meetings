## Meeting notes

Attendees:

- Andrew Brown
- Brendan Dahl
- Petr Penzin
- Yury Delendik

Notes:

1. ONNX patch and relaxed SIMD non-determinism
   1. https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/22794 – decided against following up on non-determinism
1. Half precision float implementation and performance
   1. Andew tried to replicate results together with Ilya, they agreed that infrastructure is working as intended, but still have hard time reproducing
   1. Brendan Dahl is likely to join this effort
   1. The algorithm currently upscales half precision to fp32 and then converts the result back on every operation
