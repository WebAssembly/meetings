Notes:

1. Relaxed trunc corner cases
   1. Trying to wrap up final outstanding item for relaxed-simd
   1. Trying to not avoid excessive corner cases in the core spec and test suite - underspecify there and test in embedding test suites as needed, for example WPT
   1. Add “hardware specific behavior” to the spec
1. Relaxed-simd support in ONNX runtime
   1. CI is passing, looks like it is getting close to getting merged, specific changes to kernel still need a review
1. Opens/announcements
   1. Andrew is trying to reproduce fp16 performance numbers with varying success
1. Michael McLoughlin has presented hardware-specialized wasm experience report, will try to go over details next meeting
