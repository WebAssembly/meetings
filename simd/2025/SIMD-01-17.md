## Meeting notes

Attendees:

- Andrew Brown
- Anton Kirilov
- Petr Penzin
- Yury Delendik

Notes:

1. Adjust meeting format
   1. We have been using "running agenda" for the past few meetings and it seems to be successful
   1. Change running notes format: verbose transcripts are hard to read and write, will test out using summaries instead and have a running Google Doc
1. [Relaxed SIMD tests][rsi] for FP to int conversions of OOB values
   1. Reason why Relaxed SIMD is not enabled in Firefox release
   1. Relaxing allowed output might be necessary, which might require changes to test infrastructure
   1. Need to file issue describing the problem
1. Relaxed [SIMD support][onnx] in onnxruntime
   1. Making progress, does some level of platform detection
1. Flexible vectors plans
   1. Potential benchmarks: TSVC_2, highway, jpegxl, halide, dav1d
   1. Flexible vectors execution would be a lot more similar to SVE than to x86 SIMD extensions
   1. RVV is a potential target, but not the best target for benchmarking due to hardware availability
1. [HW-Specialized WebAssembly][hw]
   1. Michael McCloughlin shared his [experience](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1528#issuecomment-2581252153)
