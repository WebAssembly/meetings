1. Opens

## Meeting notes

Attendees:

- Anton Kirilov
- Deepti Gandluri
- Petr Penzin

Notes:

1. Matrix hardware support
   1. Intel AMX and Arm SME
   1. Separate processor mode
   1. SME mode doesn’t allow Neon and scalar FP ops
   1. WebNN and WebGPU - WebGPU is for graphics shading, WebNN is a higher level primitives; Wasm might be the right place to expose exact CPU extensions
1. Exposing hardware extensions in general
   1. Apr 11 presentation on HW-accelerated Wasm - direct integration of “intrinsics” 
   1. Revec as a case study
   1. Option is to expect is a pass in runtime to optimize certain aspects of integrating intrinsics
   1. Maybe expect a pass in bytecode codegen
   1. Suggestion to do end to end intrinsic in toolchain and runtime
      1. bfdot or another dot product would be a very good candidate, it can be implemented on hardware with only standard fp32 support
1. Opens
   1. Petr is hoping to start working on toolchain support for flexible vectors
