Notes:

1. Michael McLoughlin on HW Specialized wasm experience
   1. Slides: [hwwasm-wasm-simd-talk.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdwUK9Fz3PpZ9Dp4QHMypCEEDChhNWDY/view?usp=drive_link)
   1. 1.3x difference with native for fast path, but fallback is slower than scalar C implementation
   1. Required split within Clang intrinsics layer to compile code with neon intrinsics as-is
   1. Questions about what level the intrinsics best introduced - this effort tried compiling existing Neon intrinsics, but maybe a more portable approach would be higher level SHA primitives, etc
1. Opens/announcements
   1. https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/22794 – relaxed SIMD non-determinism
      1. Concerns that patch implemented fast path on one platform, but not the other
