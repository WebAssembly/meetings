### Phase 4 preparation, review of spec text update with profiles

ZA: The spec text now includes text to talk about profiles, cherry picked from Andreas’s change which is a super set of the relaxed+deterministic semantics with a deterministic mode. The changes needed to support profiles are not extensive.

https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/pull/115

ZA: Relaxed swizzle, we already have the deterministic instruction. 

MD: The only ones that don’t have a deterministic version are FMA, and Dot product instructions

ZA: If we try to spec a deterministic FMA, we get back into the same conversation as before. The intermediate results, and range is different for a deterministic Dot product instructions

MD: But we probably want to think of ideal semantics

JM: personally thinks this looks like a good solution, seems like it is not imposing any problems we had, no slow emulation, no trapping, nothing weird, probably not that likely to get in the way of developers. the most conservative thing. if we decide to spec a deterministic mode for these instructions, it will be adding instruction to deterministic mode, doesn't break compatibility. Graceful degradation has been part of the web's DNA, Wasm doesn't have a solid story there yet.

DG: ask JM a clarification qns, what are you thinking of when you say graceful degradation w.r.t. this proposal

JM: places where you want to run this Wasm code, can't expect latest version of this engine, they can't ship all at the same time. Compounded further when users run unsupported OS, in embedded might not have new version at all. In Wasm, you build as many binaries as you support. Hard to test and ship multiple versions. Incentivizes us to implement instructions that might not be the best due to compatibility concerns.

DG: we tried to have a good answer for feature detection and conditional sections, a nicer way of detecting support. Agree that we have to work on this in the future. From the CG, in the environment where they want det, and they want to leverage FMA, the root of deterministic FMA is outside the browser. If we put this out, what feedback will we get from the CG? If we have deterministic fallback for some, and some outstanding ones, how does that look? How do we proceed with making sure we don't get feedback from folks interested in having an FMA, not sure what they will do if they are omitted in deterministic mode. Put deterministic FMA as a follow-up proposal. See if we can include them.

TL: First, the spec mechanism for the profiles looks great, and the guidance on how it’s supposed to be used looks great, subsets look good as well. The way it used in the doc is to remove the instructions, another way to be using this is to annotate the results in a way that fits the deterministic profile. For the instructions that are deterministic, there are fall backs in the profile, we could pick deterministic results

ZA: Decided to do this while I was writing the spec, because it seemed cleaner. The naming is another complication, where it’s not clear which one we would pick. 

TL: We can annotate it in the semantics, we wouldn’t need separate binaries in that case. And they can alias the other instructions in the deterministic mode

ZA: We could do that.. Either way it’ll be simpler

DG: if we alias, we will provide det semantics, open up can of worms

TL: for instructions that do not have det semantics, we can leave them out

DG: this is more conservative, maybe get more feedback from people who want to use it in deterministic mode, we can't avoid having 2 separate binaries

TL: if you leave out some, you might as well leave them all out, more feedback will be useful

MD: I would prefer to have instructions in the deterministic instructions in the deterministic mode

TL: web engines will never be running in det mode

MD: maybe in incognito

DG: not sure if we have a way to do that, privacy means not storing any user data, there is some vague fingerprinting issue, don't think we will do any different way in incognito in the engine level, at the renderer level it probably can. At least in the near term we don't expect to support deterministic mode at least in Chrome.

JM: don't think Safari would do this either, probably will be helpful if websites were compatible. Large barrier to entry if you have to implement all these instructions, small browsers, or browsers running on different platform

RW: RISCV is interesting, say there’s an ISA that came out that required a different

DG: orthogonal, with a new ISA, engines will have to do a bunch of work, will add extra overhead, in the scope of previous SIMD proposal, we are targeting a bunch of Intel and ARM devices out in the market, targeting speedups in real world. Still doesn't change the scope of this proposal, useful in the subset that we are targeting.

RW: wonder if there will be a change in the design if we know a new ISA design coming out.

JM: For SIMD, working on shipping it right now, it is an enormous engineering task - running the SIMD version is 10% slower than scalar? It makes sense to leave some set of the semantics on the deterministic mode open. We should gather more data from Wasi, or other folks that might use this before we commit to moving in one direction or the other

ZA: Any concerns with presenting at next CG meeting and phase 4?

DG: will be good to present, share updates, and discuss. Summarize in GitHub issues, cc interested stakeholders.

DG: standards opinions, any intent to ship soon?

YD: yes, want to ship thi

JM: no comments on future release, will take a while to implement
