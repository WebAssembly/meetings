### Flexible vectors

PP: presenting [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Rpz0qYJN2Lb5R98SyOQ-q2nVpuvvJUVoa5Ckh8vhOA/edit?usp=sharing)

JW: simpler lowering comparing to what

PP: comparing to using another fixed length, also in terms of virtual instruction set complexity

AK: some workloads might benefit from known length

PP: yes, text processing for example

JW: even in cases that would benefit from fixed length it is possible to get speedup with flexible approach, even if it is a smaller speedup

AB: maybe write a gemm example

AK: even if it is not the most optimal code, it might be better than the alternative

RW: should be careful about claiming that _always_ getting gains

AK: Even the ‘worse’ cases there will be some subcases that would definitely benefit from it. I am in favor of this proposal

#### Sample implementation

AK: we have draft of how most of the operations in flexible vectors can be implemented on AArch64 and are looking for a place to host it

PP: one option is to just put a doc into the repo, but if we want to be able to run it, we can try things like wasm2c or wasmtime, since I remember that someone from Arm started working on a prototype in wasmtime

AK: we stopped working on wasmtime, prefer to work on V8. Now that I think about, maybe some form of documentation would be better at this point

PP: that has been a running theme with SIMD proposals, that we need something like a ‘developer manual’ where these kind of details would be kept

YD: how we are going to measure this?

PP: a bit of chicken and egg problem, phase 2 is not yet full implementation phase. For phase 2 presentation we are mostly exploring benefits of longer simd/vector operations, but for a prototype in an engine we are thinking of creating some simple kernels first

AK: we are just looking at this theoretically, to describe what can be a reasonable lowering

PP: Another aspect is ‘developer manual’: there is basic cost, and different ways to present that, and the optimization aspects, some of that is important for standard SIMD as well

AK: I can think about a class of operations like that would benefit from optimization

YD: on subject of prototyping, we are considering implementing Flexible Vectors instead of re-vectorization

PP: great let’s discuss

AK: note that I’ve opened an issue about shuffles

PP: thank you for raising that, I’ve taken a look, but haven’t responded yet, though the suggestion looks reasonable

### Relaxed SIMD phase 4 update

PP: at in-person meeting it appears that Relaxed SIMD passed to phase 4
