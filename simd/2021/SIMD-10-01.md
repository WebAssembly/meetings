### [fpenv](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/issues/19)

DanG: fpenv is about things are not adding to the spec. If we don't have fpenv, we have to add some state somewhere. fpenv doesn't really have motivating use cases, it's about wasm having properties like modularity, and helping preserve this.

DeG: if tools default to 0 anyway, hard to connect the dots, what would we do with this if we implemented it? Don't want something to default to zero

DanG: realistically, most implementation won't do anything with it, if you're running on a single cpu/arch, you only have the same behavior. There are potential discussions where we tied fpenv to rounding modes etc, but right now fpenv represents the coprocessor you're linked with. Fpenv might not be a great name, coprocessor is the other name i've come up with. It represents the state that we want. No one ever wants a fully non-det construction. We want to do one thing or the other.

PP: we already have different behaviors on diff platforms, people are actively exploiting.

DanG: yea NaN bits, people are exploiting it just to exploit it. for FMA, people who are trying to use FMA, it might be discontiguous, or not symmetric, will mess up algorithm. Whereas nan bits, most programs don't care

PP: What if somebody uses it? Code is going to be broken?

DanG: NaN bits are what they are, it's not about preventing programs form observing non-det, it's about programs that aren't trying to observe non-det, just trying to use FMA, doesn't have smooth curves, if you have non-det that jumps between mul+add and FMA.

PP: Image rendering, multi threaded node, far fetched? The current behavior is that you can test for something, and those programs won’t work as expected. If you have a test for platform specific code, you are going to be moved to a different node with different semantics.

DanG: use case is, matmul, don't do any test, just do matrix mul, use qfma thing to do matmul and its fast. Now you discover that when your program is running, this fma is changing behavior. This is what we don't want.

PP: The current behavior is that you can have different code on different platforms, that operation

DanG: don't think we break anything here

DG: agree with Dan that we won't break anything here, when talking about NaN det, you have to explicitly test for it, this is something programmers will run into. it's a corner case if existing code test for NaN-det.

PP: if we do test for non-det and we do something based on that test

DanG: programs today test nan behavior and assume that are probably broken. You can get different NaN patterns everytime you divide 0 by 0. But programs get away with that, since we don't change NaN bits all the time. With FMA, we do want state, we don't want programs FMA changing behavior, people rely on FMA having a consistent behavior. We don't have any state now, since its NaN bits, with FMA we want state. Where do we put this state?

AK: I guess the way I’ve been thinking about this is that implementations and users won’t care about fpenv. Fpenv provides guarantees from a semantic perspective. We want fma to be deterministic across modules, if we assume instructions are consistent across modules, if a module or another module is using fma is there a way to specify a construct that guarantees that doesn’t change the semantics instead of a bytecode stream? Is there a way for us to say that the behavior within the module is same? In practice an engine will look at the CPU will uniquely determine what the lowering is.

LH: tiering up is an issue

AK: We never want the behavior to change even with FMA. USe cases - (1) Don’t care about rounding, tiering up doesn’t matter, (2) FP algorithms that reluy on FMA, but otherwise have to write a slow fall back path. If tier up breaks/changes FMA that will be a problem. It’s useful to say that in the lifetime of the module it’s useful to guarantee FMA will behave the same way.

LH: agree with that. As i said earlier, there aren't really use cases here, we need scnearios that are plausible. Believe that we don't want non-det, we want something that looks like state. About code migrating to GPU is not really credible. Need to outline what precisely we are trying to solve here.

DanG: Would it be helpful to outline use cases for algorithms that need determinism?

LH: important to talk about how they would be exposed to non-determinism, we agree that det is fine and we like that. How fpenv should solve that problem.

DaG: USe cases: GPUs come up, heterogeneous architectures, bridging modules with RPC calls, RPC calls are going through the network and talking to a different architectures. Don’t have an immediate use case, but we would be enabling these use cases.

LH: don't understand how fpenv solves that problem

DaG: It sets up an import/export relationship - that my RPC call will have the same fpenv.

LH: are you talking about fpenv with a representation on the wire? The RPC protocol actual move that from local to remote.


LH: Still useful, farfetched but applicable.

AK: Difficult to expect a system like this to work - you have to force the other system to have FMA. Then you have a negotiation across the network to have a minimum supported requirement. It feels like it could be outside of the realm of the current proposal - this new construct isn’t about,.. Existing fpenv doesn’t solve this problem, maybe you need something else to solve this.

DaG: fpenv isn't complicated, it uses module index spaces, uses imports/exports, doesn't have dynamic state, a token like linear memory, you import/export at the same time as linear memory. I'm surprised at the entire reaction that it's a complicated thing

LH: I don’t think it works as expected, it’s more to figure out a concrete use case, and how would this work in a particular scenario that solves a particular problem. How would this work in the RPC scenario?

DaG: if you don't have fpenv, you can't do this use case at all, it's never safe. Having fpenv tells you when you can and when you can't. It doesn't tell you how to do it though.

LH: That needs to be fleshed out - how is this satisfied in a practical computer, there seems to be some missing bit I’m not getting?

DaG: Can write something out - that may help explain this more.

MD: afaiu, 2 types of Wasm engines, the ones where maximal performance is requested specialized for target CPU, if host have FMA, they always generate FMA. Another implementation where code is migrated live across different systems, for this type of Wasm engine, we specify in terms of reference Wasm instructions, that's the only way the code can move and not have non-det behavior. Don't see a situation where you want to use processor specific features and still migrate this code.

ZA: We probably want to flesh this out in terms of examples, and consider what MD’s said about code migration. Another CG discussion item: Assuming we have fpenv, would we have more than one? Do we need more than one in a single module? Does anyone have some use cses?

DanG: no user will sit down and say that you have multiple fpenv in a same module, the scenario is linking, when 2 modules with fpenv are linked, then you end up with 2 fpenvs

PP: From the pov of writing code, if you have a user writing code you could have two right?

DanG: 2 can exist, not hard to implement, you can do the same thing for both of them, they don't have to be distinct.

PP: Depends on how you instantiate. There’s state that you cannot copy.. If we don’t allow for instantiating that tries to instantiate with two distinct fpenvs..

DanG: fpenv is not a first class value, a module index space, not first class, you can reference by immediate indices. fpenv is also designed where the programmer doesn't specify it. Initial version it is imported fpenv. Now it's a module construct that host initializes

PP: What about module linking/splitting? Could you hand one of your fpenv to a different one?

DanG: it's a immediate on the instruction, you can mix them however you want

LH: when you merge 2 modules, they each have fpenv, so you get 2 in the merged module. You want to use the merged module in the RPC example. What's the constrain? do they have to be the same?

DanG: Does the RPC import the fpenv? The fpenv doesn’t do anything, if the API that we’re using uses fpenv, then we should guarantee that it works, if not maybe don’t run at all?

LH: the other concern that this remoting has fpenv, otoh this thing doesn't have first class nature, it feels vague what exactly we are looking at


DanG: Similar to exporting memories/tables etc. The details are for the implementation to figure out

PP: we don't want fpenv to be first class, but we want rpcs to specify what fpenv they want

DanG: they are imports/exports, resolved at link time, in RPC that could be protocol negotiation

AK: for RPCs the future use case, there are 2 worlds, fpenv is a spec construct because we want formal, leave it in the spec without going into the implementation, another world is where there is a practical manifestation of spec langauge in the future, like the RPC, but we should have a sketch of how it would work in that use case. fpenv seems like a compromise, or at least not clear how rpc would work in the current spec. Drafting that will be helpful. If it doesn't work, we should make the construct stronger, or keep it to the spec language.

DeG: wait for Dan to write something up, then we can come back to this.

AK: can we also close some issues, multiple things

ZA: AI to consolidate the issues.

### Smaller groups of SIMD instructions (like AES)

DeG: if we are introducing extensions to SIMD, we can move to design to see if we can move this through, i would like to see use case, real applications using it, driven by use cases. One use case for 64x2 is that it's hard to do some things without them. Performance is another aspect. Can have some design consensus within this group, before presenting to CG. We can streamline and have multiple instructions, but still need strong use cases.

PP: we want to do the use cases in this group? then surface it to the CG/ move to main spec.

DeG: If someone is interested in adding an extension, we should document it ahead of time, get a first pass from this group.

PP: if someone has a SIMD instruction to explore, they can come to us first

DeG: what do you have in mind for AES? what are you looking to get out of this?

PP: I’m trying to find what else we can use AES for? From instructions perspective, relatively straightforward to implement..

LH: issue 31 about AES, decided it is not for relaxed-simd, suggested it would be spun off as its own proposal


ZA: We haven’t really had small proposals about testing how fast we can get through the process. This is one example we can try if we want to streamlined. We need use cases - PP are you interested in driving this forward?

PP: Will follow up on the issue.

ZA: Out of scope for relaxed SIMD, but in scope for the subgroup as a SIMD adjacent proposal.


### [i32x4.trunc_sat_f32x4_u](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/issues/21#issuecomment-929425797)

ZA: Relaxed version for the unsigned instructions is the only one in the current proposal that is 8 instructions long, still better than the non-relaxed version.

MD: we never had a formal req for 1 instruction lowering

ZA: Anyone disagrees/agrees?

LH: no objections

(No objections)

### [wasi-parallel](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-parallel)

PP: Announcement about WASI parallel: officially published the parallel proposal for WASI, it’s now at phase 1 in the WASI process. The idea behind this is that you have a parallel construct that can be used to run parts of the module in parallel, like how you would use OpenMP.

MD: does it only provide 1 dimensional loops?

PP: It is that at this point, it provides a way to block things, still working on figuring out what envs it will work in. We have a way to run things on the GPU, at the moment they consume CPU code. It’s WIP.

ZA: New instructions?

PP: WASI functions, uses funcrefs

DaG: Could be polyfilled potentially.

PP: Challenge is WebGPU. Less universal, OpenMP has the same problem

LH: giving a function pointer, assume entire Wasm instruction set is supported

PP: There will be things that are missing, translating to GPU operations may not always work

MD: not clear what the target of this proposal is, multi thread?

PP: To a degree both, hard to achieve both, will see what materializes. We try to add parallel programming constructs, not specifying which hardware we will be targeting. Both have pros/cons. For multithreading - lower weight threads. For GPU - if you don’t have a GPU can’t do miuch.

Welcome to Enrico!

### Instructions beyond scope of relaxed-simd

MD: considering other instructions beyond the the scope of relaxed-simd, like AES instructions?

DG: don't need to wait for big proposals, will experiment with streamlined process. soft dependency on feature-detection

MD: will be helpful to have a list of instructions for the next SIMD proposal. Right now we have everything in SSE4.1, but we go beyond that, not much. Crypto instructions for example.

ZA: Will go to the design repo and kick off a new proposal - we could come up with a SIMD v2 proposal, and would need a champion to push this forward. Would probably be useful to have a checklist for new instructions to frame the discussion.

MD: Would prefer to keep AES instructions outside of SIMD, cryptominers will hurt SIMD adoption

PP: not sure if we want to go into SIMD 2.0, unless we have a specific idea. When we do SIMD 2, it's hard to understand what it's going to do.

AK: The general topic was, when we worked a baseline of of instructions. Seems like AES, and other interesting instructions - you have to have a high baseline of SIMD instructions, the problem is that if you want all the instructions to be implementable at once, the hardware baseline becomes a problem. You will run into the problem of different hardware support, enables more fingerprinting, or polyfilling will result in a performance cliff.

PP: const 0 encoding. something like this could be in SIMD 2.0.

MD: substantial number of instructions that we didn't add in the first version that produce multiple output, e.g. NEON load struct of elements, there are also instructions to extend low and high parts. Can basically create a new proposal just out of this use case

LH: in favor of examining those more, instructions with multiple outputs. More tricky in Wasm because it is a stack machine, order of output is difficult to deal with sometimes. Can drive this from the SIMD realm, flag bits are especially hard.

DG: multi-value proposal is merged into the spec, having a dependency on that is not longer blocking.

PP: some of the things may be platform dependent, can have fallbacks. They don’t all work the same on all platforms.
