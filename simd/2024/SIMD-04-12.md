### Update and discussion on fp16 support

Ilya Rezvov presenting https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Q_DQoy2Cv3kx4s6C-Atk3qcYBfL1YiHLYGMyWc63Ks/edit?usp=sharing

PP: this is IEEE FP16, right?

IR: yes

PP: Loading FP16 would not add any operations on the value?

IR: It is a converting load, it would load f16 and convert it to f32

AK: Did you discover any scalar operation that doesn’t have a vector equivalent? This doesn’t invalidate your main point though

IR: Not sure, I might have missed it, mostly vectors

AK: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2024-03/SIMD-FP-Instructions/FADD--scalar---Floating-point-Add--scalar--?lang=en

DG: Platforms are moving to supporting FP 16 (AVX10 is coming to x86 too), maybe eventually we can reconsider, but for now limiting it to vector operations makes sense

PP: AVX10 is also going to be a SIMD instruction set, it makes sense to focus on SIMD

DG: Float16Array is going to propose a new rounding mode for FP64->FP16 conversion, we should watch how that plays out

PP: On scalar vs vector, would implementing SIMD emulation also be a pretty large change?

IR: It is pretty complex as well, but it is well worth it because it would enable new workloads and bring performance close to native

(PP, side note: later in the deck there was an estimate for that effort and it is lower than the scalar)

DG: SIMD performance is lower comparing to native than it used to be because native performance increased, often because of new instructions, but Wasm hasn’t kept up

PP: We have some gaps in the toolchain, though that would only help the baseline. We should probably consider standard fallbacks for new operations

DG: I wish the standard fallback existed

PP: There was a proposal to support fallbacks via expressing new virtual instructions in terms of old ones

DG: This might be hard on some platforms because there are less variety of approaches to implement fallback (ex: x86 has multiple SIMD extensions, while Arm has less flexibility)

DG: we encourage people to file issues on the proposal repo for discussions

IR: plan to go to phase 2 once discussions settle down
