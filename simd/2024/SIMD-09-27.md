### Hardware Specialized WebAssembly

AB giving an overview of https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1528, interested in feedback.

AK is wondering how software emulation would work for the bultins that are not supported on the platform.

AB: there is a detection mechanism whether a builtin a supported natively by the platform.

AK: If developer providing an alternative implementation, it likely would be different from implementation that uses the accelerative version, would that be an issue

AB: As an example, XNNPACK would provide different kernel implementations based on hardware support

AK: Would this be similar to high-level API?

AB: The CG discussion is leaning towards limiting the size of the builtins, I personally think that is maybe OK to try that, at least explore it

AK: Another question - maintaining builtins database, if we worry about the speed of CG proposals, this might be similar

AB: That might be a concern, though for the sake of trying this, we might want to lift process restrictions and let engines adds builtins

AK: Centralized process would reduce the risk of multiple builtins with slightly different semantics

AB: The proposal includes a way to ensure that fallback code is doing what is expected

YD: We have experience with a builtin implementation already where we load imported functions and then substitute with native implementation with a fallback path, that is pretty much identical to the proposal. The downside is that it is hard for developers to rely on fast builtin functions. This is not exposed to the web, only on extension level, look up mozIntGemm, also ticket: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1720747

AK: From our experience with optimized implementations, addition of new instructions is a bit easier for developers to target.

AK: For the libraries required as native implementation there is going to be an issue with integration, as engines are implemented differently

PP: This is going to be an issue for long builtins and less for the ones producing a single instruction

YD: We need to have the builtins integrated into our compilation pipelines to integration with register allocation, etc

AK: Couple thoughts. The registry should be machine-readable, which I think you have already. This can be even used to add assembly sequences to that, but maybe at a later point. Assembly templates that proposal discusses might help.

PP: Worth (again) mentioning that CG process plays a role, and maybe we need to improve that to some extent. On the other hand, opcode space is so full it is worth to relieve some pressure there.

AK: What is the deprecation process? I think that is one of the motivations for the CG process.

YD, AB: fallback _is_ the depreciation process

YD: Who would be the authority to add/remove the builtins?

PP: There is a case to be made of having more than one authority/registry

AB: Builtins subgroup, which would figure that out eventually?

YD: Can we borrow from JS builtins, maybe

AB - asks BD and SR for any thoughts

BD is curious about the tool integration story, AK suggests function multiversioning. 

YD: JS strings is the going be similar to this proposal

AK: Bulk memory ops couldâ€™ve been implemented via this style of proposal
