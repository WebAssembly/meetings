### Update and discussion on FP16

AB: I am curious about instruction lowering and when hardware support for it would be available across the board

IR: (Shares link to [Lowering](https://github.com/WebAssembly/half-precision/blob/main/proposals/half-precision/Lowering.md))
This works at the moment with AVX512 and will work with AVX10.2, which is officially published.

AB: Hardware for this feature (AVX10.2) is not going to be available for some time.

IR: As a standard I think we can count on this being available, and we can do emulation for now. 

AB: Emulation is going to be very slow on current hardware.

DG: We need to better define what emulation means. FP16 capabilities are important on all hardware, and what we have today in wasm is not sufficient. Andrew, I am curious what your position is, as we are working with other groups at Intel on AVX10 enablement.

AB: There are a few conflicting directions here: AVX10 is one aspect, competitiveness is a different one.

DG: We are looking for compute performance specifically on ML workloads. There are different directions on what different participants want from the standard, which is a difficult problem to solve evenly for everyone.

AB: I feel we are playing whack-a-mole with hardware features, as we have lots of conflicting ways to extend this.

DG: That is a good point, but the question is how to solve it? I.e. not adding instructions can be a disservice to our users.

AB: Maybe we can do more in engines, for example how revectorization project was implemented.

DG: The concern for such implementations is adoption, and we do more and more we might affect that. Spec has to be useful for the users.

PP: The issue with revectorization is that pattern detection is fragile, users need have to produce kernel code that matches expected. There was a different approach floated around a few times, about defining standard fallbacks, i.e. defining extensions in terms of existing wasm instruction - user would either get hardware acceleration or a valid wasm alternative.

AK: I am curious about revectorization and what handshake is needed to detect it.

DG: It is kernel pattern detection, and some kernels might need to be compiled with that detection in mind.

AK: That means that instead of 128-bit optimized kernels you need to produce 256-bit optimized kernels?

DG: In a way, you might need to use a different vector length in the compiler.

PP: XNNPACK is also detecting x86 vs Arm, if you want to extend revec to both platform you probably have to disable that check.

IR: I feel people prefer to have predictable performance, and probably emulation needs to be detected somehow. Please join discussions in FP16 repo.

AB: I am advocating for a more high level approach, and maybe we should investigate standard fallbacks that were mentioned. For example encryption/decryption functionality that can benefit from commonly available encryption instruction.

DG: We are looking for better developer story, just having one API for something is very restrictive, while needing to take all possible hardware features into account is a lot of overhead.

AK: Andrew, what you mention sounds like wasi-nn, right?


AB: I think it would subsume wasi-nn, as there are even more features, like AMX, and the problem is performance portability. I think in many of these cases we can’t reach exact consensus for these but we need to figure out a way to run common functions for important use case in a way that is optimized for underlying hardware. What if we can create a list of these specific functions and, say, hashing these functions to specific machine-optimized implementations.

DG: We thought about this, and it raises compatibility concerns as in what is optimized where.

AB: Developers don’t have to necessarily match hardware.

DG: This would definitely work for new code, but with existing applications users often want to just swap the existing header file with new one.

PP: How would this work, would this list of functions be public? How would a user reference them in the code - compile from source or drop in from a wasm library.

AB: Yes, I think we definitely collect possible use cases for these.

IR: I can’t see how we can use this for FP16 since it is a different data type

DG: prototyping is still in progress, might not be all available in dev Chromium builds, we can follow up offline if you want to try it.
