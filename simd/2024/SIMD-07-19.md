### Horizontal operations

https://github.com/WebAssembly/flexible-vectors/issues/65

AK: The goal is to pattern match some vector additions and some shuffles.

PP: was hoping to talk about this before LLVM patch gets merged … What is the pattern?

AK: AFAIK the patch produces horizontal operations as a series of addi

PP: yes, there seems to be fp32

AK: this should help other runtiems

PP: we should document that, given this is a bit more hardware oriented patch

AK: there was a patch for integer splats vs integer … Were horizontal ops discussed in SIMD proposal before?

PP: https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/20 There are some concerns for performance

AK: Horizontal ops are also slower on Arm, but still useful

AB: Looking at the LLVM PR. Seems like patch adds pairwise rather than split in half, why was that done?

AK: The original output had shuffle masks that would change with subtle changes to input

PP: Since this is pairwise would this interact with x86 pattern matching?

YD: We are working on shuffle lowering for horizontal min. Shuffles generated for autovectorized ops are not performance efficient and non-deterministic. Sometimes part of the shuffle mask represent lanes that are discarded. We are having a problem when we can’t make the right selection for either Arm or x86. I am wondering shold we even have a shuffle with non-deterministic output.

AK: Horizontal min reduction

PP: discarded lane indices (FK’s patch)

AK: Neon only has byte shuffles, SVE has other shuffles

YD: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1887312

PP: what is the incompatibility between x86 and Arm here

YD: For example rotate produces a shuffle that is matches neither of the two styles… Autovectorizer

AK: in Sam’s notes one of the places this is coming from is SPEC, autovectorizer

PP: there is cost model problem
