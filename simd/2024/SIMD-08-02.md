## Continue discussion of shuffle masks

https://github.com/WebAssembly/flexible-vectors/issues/66

PP: do you have sources?

YD: no, but I can reproduce it via simple C++ code, something like:

```
unsigned char arr[10000];
unsigned char m = 0; for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) if (a[i] < m) m = a[i]
```

PP: We should suggest to LLVM how to generate better patterns for these operations

YD: You have to load the mask into a register, perform the shuffle and then post-process the results

PP: Having a few of them in a row would really explode register usage

AK: There is still value to add horizontal reduction to Wasm irrespective of whether we do something about loop tails in LLVM. Not sure about the other three examples.

YD: https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime

PP: Pattern 3 looks like 8->32 bit extend, but the 4 elements it extending it would produce

AK: If we have this flexibility we could broadcast the element. Non-determism w.r.t masks

YD: Maybe we can ask relaxed variant

PP: In flexible vector proposal we can express just the shrinking if we implement per-value length, but it is likely would just move uncertainty somewhere lese

YD: the only way to experiment is to measure ONNX, we should figure out how to run that s a benchmark

YD: Bugzilla bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1887312

PP: Maybe this is the source: https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js

YD: Don’t yet know why V8 is faster

AK: Maybe it is matching specific permutation patterns

PP: to summarize maybe disable LLVM, adding operation, and indicate indices to be ignored in the result. Numbers would be good if we are going to present new instruction proposals.

AK: Similar question for flexible vectors, if you get a value and then increase its length

YD: maybe set the lanes to zero explicitly by a SIMD `and` after the shuffle and pattern match on that

PP: would that be too much dataflow analysis for JS engine?

YD: don’t know yet, but we are considering adding an additional pass for dataflow

PP: maybe room for dataflow in other direction by taking lanes out of explicitly zero value if only one value really used

YD: maybe also interleave

PP: LLVM can produce some cheaper pattern, like splat of 4-byte lane, but that goes back to LLVM not having a cost model
