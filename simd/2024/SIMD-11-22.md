https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/pull/144 and https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/pull/140

YD: this was passing on some particular test because liftoff was producing just the right output, neither turbofan, nor liftoff pass this test

YD: 140 is adding alternative values produced by other engines, AR in 144 said that was rather arbitrary

EN: can we just accept any value when a NaN value is passed

PP: converting NaN to int is not a valid operation, should that be an error?

YD: if we tighten the semantics (i.e. raise error) we get non-relaxed version

EN: what is the difference between relaxed and strict?

YD: number of operations

PP: if you sanitize the inputs you end up with more instructions

EN: Can we consider this behavior undefined?

PP: spec really tries to avoid undefined, I do support the idea that we might not need this operation

YD: maybe we should check the use cases are in the wild, xnnpack, onnx runtime. Will open an issue, want to know what Andreas has to say about it

BD: xnnpack doesnâ€™t seem to use this particular intrinsic (and it doesn't use autovectorization)
