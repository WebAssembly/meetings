### Formalizing non-determinism in relaxed SIMD

MD (about dot products and fma):

AK: for other operations we don’t have the same use case when we can test edge cases like this

MD: there is lane select and others, other can be used this way too

CW: we want to give guarantees about what programs can rely on

DG: Areseny, you mention engine can pick FMA vs two ops. If one can detect single fma, they can get it, but it would be slower.

AK: yes, there are classes of algos, where you can use either single or double, and others when you need one or the other. We don’t want people replacing qfma with fma unless they understand the cost.

CW: wrt to your recent post, for programs that want to take mul ad to replace with qfma, do they rely error state within tolerance, or result is exactly repeatable when doing calculation twice?

AK: it depends, some cases where it doesn't matter, some cases where the paths in the program differs. It is hard to know. Large class of C programs, GCC -O3 can occasionally lower a*b+c to fma. Large class of programs compiled from C to assembly with this setting, and it works. If we have set non-det for qfma, it is not end of the world. Not sure if this is a better world than list-non-determinism. What are we gaining from set non-det, while a lot of implementations will be list non-determinism, we are losing some valuable properties, and it is worth it? Every time i need to do a feature gate, it's a major pain, as an application developer on top of Wasm, won't use any of this tricks, maybe not worth it, gets complicated fast.

MD: very hard to do, not the target use case for this proposal. Looking at which instructions you can test for behavior and specialize, pretty much of all them.

AK: if there is a use case for qfma, support it as a principle, might as well support for other instructions?

CW: main benefit for set non-det, is keeping the spec editorially not perturbed by this proposal. Trying to work this out if it is possible.

DG: also minor benefit to deterministic fma. There are cases in engine we assume list determinsm, that's something the spec allows, set-non-det gives engine more leeway. From engine perspective, if a less inform application dev uses this without any sort of checking, the only thing is checking is that their algo is slow, better than not working.

AK: there is a special question if we should have a separate FMA instruction. Haven't seen the lowering?

DG: will call out to c intrinsics

AK: there is a lowering to intrinsics, ignores all edge case inputs, can all to c element per element, will be slow. If we add this it should not be called FMA, call it precise FMA, has to be specific qualifier to indicate so.

PP: CW gave a presentation last time about care v.s. not care. This matters for FMA because of single v.s. double rounding. Important to test for corner cases. Second point is that from toolchain POV, having a don't care FMA can be either is beneficial then compilers don't have to worry if user really wanted a single or double rounding.

AK: that part is same between list and set. By default, the compiler will not automatically synthesize it. Assume -ffast-math, if targeting relaxed-simd, using mul+add, will then use qfma. This will be the same between set and list. Doesn't matter for compiler/toolchain whether the spec says list or set. The user needs to tell toolchain it doesn't care anyway.

PP: it's less concerning because there is a special instruction.

CW: practically reproducing bugs, what's in the spec doesn't matter, what matters is formal blanket, if the result is not something you expect, does the spec cover it?

AK: in overview we are saying we use set non-determinism

CW: this looks out of date

AK: if we have the list non det, the scope of this guarantee is ambiguous, has to work within the same module, does it work across different modules, what’s the formalism. Set guarantees you nothing.

CW: Writing the guarantee down formally is tough.

AK: what actually happens, for example web workers? same result? what is the actual scope?

CW: some mobile phones have different CPU cores, could it be FMA changes between low and core?

MD: behavior doesn't, performance does.

AK: weird bugs on Android versions where instructions not available on some cores, code migrated and it crashes

PP: super unlikely

MD: for practical purposes, all ARM devices have FMA

MD: if guarantee is single module, would it work for what you have in mind. Either compile time or runtime, everything that links together.

CW: has to be all modules using a single store, where all modules can see one another

AK: classic technique where you have a tiny detector module where you run, then pick a different wasm module to load based on that. This are in different stores?

CW: formally they are in the same store once they are loaded

MD: for detecting Wasm SIMD, this is done in JS, if you try to run Wasm SIMD that don't run it. That's different for Relaxed SIMD, you can test fo specific semantics within the binary itself.

PP: you can still can do it, you can run a small module that makes the checks. Can write modules with different semantics baked in, and load based on it.

MD: that's not guaranteed to work, and don't think we should try to make it work.

CW: they way we formalize list non det will allow that to work.

PP: if you depend on CPUID, you won't write code like that

PP: an example that has been brought up is a future runtime can that move code across arch and servers, caveat that it doesn't yet exist, there are people who want it. will set-non-det break stuff?

CW: set-non-det actually allows that, if we formalize list on-det, but allow stuff to migrate, it will break

DG: cannot confuse what spec allows v.s. what implementations do, treat them separately

CW: not hanging my hat for why set non-det is a good thing, based on the hypotheticals

AK: one option, change list-non-det to set-non-det, as part of that, add precise fma, no option of not adding itl. We get optimal implementation of various algos that require single rounding FMA, we get theoretical problems about not-det runs, invalidate some techniques that Marat talking about, for some instructions, you have no option to check instructions behavior. Other possibility is to keep list-non-det, results in problems in the spec, may restrict engine optimizations in some ways, still under this option may or may not add precise FMA. In that world. precise FMA feels less defendable.

CW: accurate summation.

MD: without list-non-det, can't test if FMA is fast

AK: test if qfma is rounding once, very likely that FMA is fast, no guarantees, but no guarantee that it is fast. But unlikely that single rounding is a slow FMA. Engines that runs on hardware that supports single rounded fma may choose to do mul+add on QFMA, maybe 1 cycle fast or 2 cycle faster, some imbalance there. An engine can ever return you a single rounded result is unlikely to implement it using a software fallback. If it is double rounded, something is wrong, fallback, if single rounded, likely precise FMA is good.

CW: will absolutely put a note about this in the spec, unless an Engine wants to trick

NC (chat): AMD Ryzen FMA has fast throughput but slow latency. Separate mul/add is generally better there if you care about latency.

AK: this might be why we want precise FMA regardless

MD: this is a reason to not go with set-non-det, will make it untestable, an engine can for each QFMA, detect if latency or throughput constraint, use FMA for some, or mul+add. If you try to test, it would have always use double rounding.

AK: say we spec gfma and precise with set, then we can end up with two classes of programs: on tests qfma, and the other might replace everything with qfma for speed.

CW: each set and list will have analogous failure more in both. If we spec set non-det, we can move to list non-det, that refines it if we get it wrong. If we spec list, we are stuck with it.

MD: in practice, have a lot of software depend on list-non-det.

AK: see a lot in C world, actual practical spec is stricter, it can break the world. This is almost optimal, we have to upgrade the spec in a sense.

MD: will prefer to have this guarantee right away

AK: there is a danger that there is a gap

PP: set-style is less strict of a specification

MD: worried about lack of formal guarantees for testing, if we don't guarantee that same inputs produce same outputs

PP: lke floats?

AK: there are some, programs rely on it

MD: set-non-det for NaNs, not user visible, no function in C to get the payload

AK: sign also

MD: NaN propagation, no standard function in C to get this non-det components, not visible for programmers, what we have here is user-visible effects

CW: not user-visible from a looser specification that fast math lets you do, but practically visible

AK: one reason to prefer list, if we can specific FMA with single round, performance cliff. The idea of list determinism, what is the closest we can get to full determinsm without performance cliff. MVP SIMD was not doing this. Here, what is the strictest possible behavior that is feasible and useful. Impact of set-non-det in spec to user is minimal, impact in this proposal is more obvious, may be reasons to try to see how to make list works. Or something stricter?

CW: even stricter is correlation between instructions.

PP: in practice you get one result from a particular platform, you can't emulate them efficiently

AK: edge cases where some specific cpus with this slow instruction

PP: understand the argument that with list-determinsm, can see what results you will get, danger is that they write and test on one platform and not others

AK: say you have triplets of FP values, and sorting is on FMA of values. Comparator under set-non-det is wrong. Can have different results on for FMA on the same element, if you use QFMA for this predicate, you problem under set-non-det, invokes C++ undefined behavior. Under list non-det, you aren't getting the deterministic sort order on every arch, but it works, produces a correct sort order. Programs is more often sound than not.

PP: why is it undefined?

MD: if you use predicate to sort, it can produce different results on same element

AK: every program using fastmats, is set-non-det. Program switch fastmath don't care.

MD: more than fast math, same code in same function produces same results, inline in multiple places, actually in multiple places, multiple lowerings.

PP: also different flavors of fast math

AK: not end of the world if we do set non-det, I'm suggesting that there are simple programs where you use QFMA with set-non-det, and the breakage is not obvious from spec perspective, whether you observe it in practice.

PP: forgot about the different ways to lower in the same program. Fastmath is argument to use set non-det, though one can argue we can try to be stricter than the C compiler.

AK: for programs that use relaxed simd and simd in general, as a by product of running either fast math on a SIMD program with intrinsics, or by product of autovectorizing a c program, none of which pushes us to list or set. Requirements is that they need strict, or completely don't care.

PP: list non det falls between strict C compiler and fast math mode. realistically we can go all the way to set, that's what fast math does

CW: if talking about people hand writing instrinsics, talking about someone who knows what they are doing, are they facilitated in writing the program they want to.

AK: example in [thread](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/issues/86#issuecomment-1279181850), small set of core libraries optimized with intrinsics, can have a matrix by vector multiply, implemented once and used widely, do we want to subject all users of this to non-det, which kind is appropriate? Beneficial to have stronger guarantees.

CW: morally, can be written using fastmath C, but chose to write intrinsics

MD: i have code that breaks with fastmath, but still can use qfma

AK: biggest worry if all implementation have list, programs are relying on this promise, compiler can be broken by optimizer, and engines introducing random behavior.

CW: the kind of hazards we are imagining are people hand writing, assumes a level of deliberateness.

AK: it is still a hazard, easy to miss. Like this sort example, if you do the same computation on the same data, have to be aware that it could produce different result. Increases the barrier. If QFMA produces set-non-det, we will likely see experts using intrinsics, end up writing programs per spec, not working properly, don't expect qfma returns different results. Not everyone who learns Wasm/Relaxed SIMD will write code that QFMA can result different results every time.

DG: should we take a poll?

ZN: maybe we should postpone Phase 4 vote

DG: we can still take a vote and present it to the group when we discuss it
CW: list vs set is not to delay next phase

AK: we should agree if we should add deterministic FMA.

DG: set det + det FMA or list det without det FMA.

ZN: we will set up a poll on Github
