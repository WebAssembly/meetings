### Finalizing the specification for Phase 4 vote

CW: want to discuss non-determinism, float idea of deterministic FMA

DG, MD: we would have to discuss that later, Zhi is out, also sounds he might have addressed it

DG: anything else we need to consider?

MD: Good on my side. I implemented optimizations using relaxed-simd in xnnpack, got very good speedup

DG: looks like FMA speedup is lower than we expected

MD: expect changes in register allocation is causing this, need to check

DG: can you also try it in Firefox nightly, looks like it is implemented

YD: Available in firefox nightly by default. Current status is that FMA and FNMA operands need to be swapped and BFloat16 operations need to be implemented.
Relaxed SIMD preferred on by default in Nightly (off in release)

DG: V8 situation is similar


### Deterministic FMA

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dJhqnAZOjh8ppCKivDl--niaUgpKV44--IMX1EF1SA0/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0

CW (presenting): happy with 99% of what is in spec, just hoping to make formal semantic simpler to require less spec extension. I think there are two kinds of operations: where we care about the variability and where we only need to avoid it.

MD: the idea is that most of the operations are useful without testing for specific behavior

CW: the point is that some operations can be changed to traditional “range” non-determinism we use in core spec, this would not prevent anyone from still detecting which semantics they get

TL: since there are programs that are dependent on additional detection, this should not break anything

CW: more interesting cases are instructions where we have to encode the options, for example single vs double rounding in FMA, where that would require a different algorithm. The proposal is to add deterministic instructions in addition to non-deterministic ones for just those cases. This way we would not need to add new type of non-determinism to the spec, which also helps with forward compatibility, it is easier to narrow to list non-determinism, than to remove it later. Also helps support potential new architectures in the future.

TL: the programs that would use something like this can be already broken if an engine would make somewhat random choices w.r.t what we have here. Why not just make all instructions use range non-determinism?

CW: we should probably care about cases like FMA, when assumptions are required.

MD: it would be challenging to polyfill a deterministic SIMD FMA, this would be very expensive

CW: in cases like this I would probably prefer list non-determinism

PP: It feels like we just get FMA & QFMA both, is that bad?

CW: Either we introduce a new idea of non-derteminism, or we introduce an instruction that may not have completely predictable performance

MD: In which way does it not have predictable performance?

CW: Emulated FMA may be slower

MD: Wasm doesn’t guarantee performance, see popcount operation

CW: In that sense I think new operation is more palatable

MD: why do we need the new operation?

DG: for the spec to be more flexible in the future

MD: the test for qfma behavior means you can just use qfma in those two different ways

AB: allowing use cases where we might want to move computation to other architectures is more important outside the browser

DG: To distill, what Conrad is proposing would result in less testing.

JM: I like the idea of range non-determinism, it would be useful for web compat. On the other hand I don’t like the “very slow emulation” aspect of the additional proposed instructions. Maybe just leave

TL: in practical terms new FMA would only add an ability to write badly slow programs

PP: I think having list semantics on some operations is better than on all operations, however there is a case for new operations. From practical point of view of having slow programs, we have already enabled this with SIMD popcount.

CW: adding list non-determinism in one spot is pretty much the same as adding in many places.

MD: testing semantics that can change while program is executing is very hard.

PP: from practical point of view they won’t change

TL: runtimes that can move executions that we discussed above 

DG: we are at time, we should continue discussing this offline, given that we won’t have another meeting before Phase 4 vote

CW: one final note: I would prefer adding new instructions, though having lists across the board is my second option, I’d rather not change the semantics to sets and still expect our current qfma tests.
