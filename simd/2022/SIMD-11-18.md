### Relaxed mode next steps

TL: is it a no for keeping, or no for removing

ZA: no for keeping

DG: semantic change overall, out of scope for relaxed simd, there is a part of proposal for relaxed mode

AB: can be done separate, after relaxed mode in in place

PP: Dan is not here so hard to discuss there, could be added later

ZA: path forward is to tidy up and present to CG?

DG: worthwhile to talk about relaxed mode and profiles in the CG, before including it. few people seem to have opinion about it, preemptively handle ahead of time, discussion on profiles repo is quite recent, ideas on how to clean that up, what the goals are

ZA: are you suggesting we show relaxed mode, and show how it fits into profile

DG: can do this in partnership with Dan, point the group at relaxed mode, doesn't need a full talk, need to  see how CG feels about it

PP: reading through profiles, talks about features to include or exclude, not 100% clear if an instruction does different things in different modes, that's something to clarify, idea is pretty much the same

DG: orthogonal, that's a spec mechanism to state what instructions are supported in what mode, in deterministic mode you have relaxed SIMD in non-relaxed mode. those 2 are orthogonal.

PP: Dan's presentation has instructions that work in both modes, although you could entirely remove them in strict mode.

AB: want to agree with DP, to check in with profiles work to make sure that this is going to align with that, before doing too much work. Think it will align. Have not been voting on some of these polls because I feel uncomfortable about the decisions we are making that are picking winners and losers in the ISA world. Addition of relaxed mode gives a way to express Intel semantics in a way, but we are fragmenting the Wasm concept to do that, can really only get that semantics in some fragment. Don't feel great about that in the future. In the future with new instructions, will we fragment further. Semantics for different ISA are not coalescing.

TL: Is that a fundamental objection to existence of the relaxed SIMD proposal? How do you feel this is actionable?

AB: not super actionable, if we get relaxed mode, we have some way to express Intel semantics, 2 years down the road when we have 20 versions of this, then what?

DG: address the philosophical fragmentation issues, Wasm is expanded to different needs, whether on cloud, server, embedded. At some point fragmentation is unavoidable, we some way to state what features are important, some structured way. In general not realistic that in 2 years we have so many different semantics. Silicon moves slower, adoption is slower. VMs don't easily adopt that.

PP: it's not only Intel, it's x86 semantics. Share same sentiment too. Some validity to being careful to what we add. Adding is much easier than removing. Canonical nan use case is writing interpreters.

DG: there's a balance there, be careful and add very few things. We want to enable applications and move the standard forward. Especially when we are in the early stage of adoption, need to be judicious about risk and tradeoff

PP: Agree completely. We cannot just chase a narrow use case, not the case for relaxed simd.

ZN: Sync with Dan, and see how we can share this at the next CG meeting

AB: Are we all agreed with DG that canonicalization of NaNs should not be a part of the relaxed SIMD proposal?

MD: agree, it affects beyond SIMD

PP: single NaN value for deterministic profile

MD: maybe in the scope for deterministic profile once it gets to the stage

AB: it can be argued at that stage then

DG: meeting next week, but it’s also the Thanksgiving week

ZN: Will sync with Dan and schedule

### Request to test testing instructions

MD: request to add specific instructions for testing which way it is implemented, for relaxed madd, is it fma or separate mul + add. This request came from Apple, idea is that if they get bug report if a webpage works or doesn't on certain archs, want to figure out if it is relying on some specific feature.

MD: since we are exposing implementation specific options, it is possible to start using them, so we should explicitly provide functions to test for them, so that browsers can quickly know if this was used.

PP: have to disassemble the whole module to see if people are testing it, maybe canonical pattern, but have to disassembly the module

MD: in order to test for specific implementation, from engines POV, there is no difference between modules that test for implementation specific instructions

TL: wider CG will have strong opinions on implementation specific instructions, should have this in a public issue.

DG: at this point, the realistic expectation is to relitigate this every couple of weeks. Confused about the testing issue, what Justin is testing for. Will expect that to be very hard to get approval for. From engine perspective, there are only a couple of valid semantics.

PP: 2 sides to this, in general instructions with single or double rounding, it's more critical. E.g. if OOB lanes, you can test x86 or ARM. If you want to test FMA, you provide 3 values and test output for exact bit pattern. We don't know what 3 floating point values you will use. If you get a bug report that it is report, you don't know if it is testing fma. It's not that you get a NaN and check the sign. If you provide an explicit way to do it, you won't have to guess.

DG: there's no reason you need to have that in a spec. You can put that in a function or a document. What do you propose we include in the spec.

PP: sounded like an actual instruction which says if fma is single rounding.

MD: yes, is relaxed madd single rounding.

DG: more useful to have when Justin is present, hard to annotate all the semantics that can be used. You could hardware the engine to generate muladd and see if it works. Different ways we can do it, what sort of exported functions we can use to test bit patterns, can document it somewhere.

### Instruction for every variant

MD: Ben wanted to expose each implementation option as an explicit instruction.

TL: agree that it is not desirable

PP: if we cannot get CG to agree on the mode, then we do this. Will be much worse performance.

DG: should have consensus that we are willing to push for relaxed mode. We don't want to entertain all of the options presented

MD: phase 4 relaxed simd?

ZA: probably not, present relaxed mode, then poll

DG: cannot over index on one or two influential members. put onus on them to come to meeting and discuss options

PP: will try not to attempt to go for something important during holiday week

DG: 6 weeks is a long time, even if we decide to present relaxed mode, and then poll the room.

PP: not really solving what people have complained about, pushes discussions...

DG: you introduce all forms of intrinsics, applications only use what makes theirs fast, you also introduce user confusion on which to use, and what differences there are

PP: intrinsics are not a good idea, introduce deterministic variants maybe better, but we don’t have to seriously entertain them until we discuss the modes

ZA: to summarize, we will focus on two modes, I’ll sync up with Dan and we will ask Justin to put his concern into an issue
