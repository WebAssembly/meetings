## Meeting notes

###  PERFWUME: A model based toolchain for evaluating performance of wasm runtimes

[slides](./perfwume.pdf)


JB: What contributes to jitter? Is it latency or performance?

AC: Context switching was contributing to jitter. 

JB: Is there any difference if you were running native?

AC: The jitter observed was very similar in both native and Wasm.

JB: Are there any plans on open sourcing the work done as part of this
toolchain?

AC: Study A is already open source. It doesn't exist in a GitHub repository, it's a zip file. Other studies are not open and need approval.

AB: Each experiment is a complex row. One of the slides is using a very specific WASI-SDK and a different version of wasm-opt. All those variables matter and make the benchmarking more complex. 

AC: The last study is taking care of ensuring that the toolchains versions are controlled.

DB: Different wasm-opt versions might impact performance, as pointed by Adrew. Has anyone experienced performance differences between wasm-opt versions?

AB: Hasn't experienced performance differences, but sometimes in different versions different sizes are observed.
