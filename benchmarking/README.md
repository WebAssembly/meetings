# WebAssembly Benchmarking Subgroup Charter

The Benchmarking Subgroup is a sub-organization of the [WebAssembly Community
Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) of the W3C. As such, it is
intended that its charter align with that of the CG. In particular, the sections
of the [CG charter](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/) relating to
[Community and Business Group
Process](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#process), [Contribution
Mechanics](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#contrib),
[Transparency](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#transparency), and
[Decision Process](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#decision) also
apply to the Subgroup.

## Goals

The mission of this subgroup is to provide a forum for collaboration on
benchmarking efforts for WebAssembly programs, sharing best practices, tools,
and knowledge related to benchmarking.

## Scope

The Subgroup will consider topics related to benchmarking of WebAssembly, including:

- Best practices for benchmarking WebAssembly
- Development and sharing of benchmarking tools
- Knowledge sharing about existing benchmarks, systems, and projects
- Public, high-level, recommendations about best practices, frameworks, suites, metrics, for WebAssembly benchmarking

## Deliverables

### Non-normative reports

The Subgroup may produce non-normative material such as requirements documents,
recommendations, and use cases related to benchmarking.

### Software

The Subgroup may produce software related to benchmarking of WebAssembly, including but not limited to:

- Benchmarking tools specifically designed for WebAssembly
- Libraries or frameworks to aid in the benchmarking of WebAssembly applications
- Distilling and collating WebAssembly benchmarking suites. 

### Specifications

The Subgroup may produce amendments and extensions to existing WebAssembly
proposals or propose the creation of new proposals leading to better
instrospection (e.g profiling/tracing) for WebAssembly. 

## Amendments to this Charter and Chair Selection

This charter may be amended, and Subgroup Chairs may be selected by vote of the full WebAssembly Community Group.
