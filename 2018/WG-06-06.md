**POLL: The Wasm WG should recommend that Ben Smith become our new WG chair to the W3C.**

Unanimous consent.

### Discussion on status of the Working Draft.

Brad plans to hand Tab Atkins a 1 page howto doc on the bikeshed plumbing for the spec.

Mutable globals:

We discussed having a poll last time, but forgot to put it on this agenda. Since it was in the previous meeting notes, reasonable to take the poll this time. 

AR: What’s the status of the proposal?

BS: When we passed from CG to WG, the CG had determined that it was ready to go (phase 4).

BN: Doesn’t currently ship in Chrome, but it’s on track to ship

LW: Riding the “rails” in FF, will ship soon

What other proposals need to be integrated? 

Clarify that JSAPI i32 conversions are signed
Limits change from titzer
Serialization if it does end up making the cut

AI(Ben Smith) move these forward until they can be integrated.

BN: May need to run Pub checker again, since it’s been a while

KM: Is there a nice diff view for mutable global proposal against spec?

BN: There may be tooling for this in Bikeshed.

AR: It’s a good point in general, for larger diffs this will be useful.

BN: Will send email to w3c asking about this.

**POLL: We should merge the Mutable Global proposal into v1 of the spec.**

SA|A|N|F|SF
-|-|-|-|-
0|0|0|1|8

A few abstained.

AI: Ben to merge in the proposal.

AR: Technical question; what is the difference between abstaining and neutral? Perhaps if we need a quorum?

BN: Not much of a difference. Mostly just so we don’t look back and wonder why we made decisions.

### Future meetings

KM: Is it necessary to have these every 2 weeks? Maybe just every month.

BN: Perhaps leave it up to the chair.

### Confirm next meeting date + time.

BS: Let's keep it bi-weekly, but cancel aggressively. For cancellation, let’s remove the calendar invite and send out emails.

### Closure
