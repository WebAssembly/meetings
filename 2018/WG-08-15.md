Discussing working on a working draft.

Ben: We should put out a Working Draft. We need to include substantive changes and a public record of the WG recommending a new WD. I’ve included the changes for the core spec in this gist (above).

Luke: How did you compile the diffs?

Ben: The w3c has a html diff tool, I looked through manually to find the diffs. Mostly typographical and small bug fixes. Big change was adding mutable globals.

Ben: We also are supposed to put out a new draft every 6 months, so this would be good timing for that. Do we have unanimous consent to put out a new WD?

[unanimous consent]

Keith Miller: Any opposition to moving this meeting to 9am PST? It would be better for me, but perhaps it’s better for Europeans at this time?

Ben: It would be better for me too. I’ll send out an email to the announce mailing list with the new time, asking whether it works for others too.
