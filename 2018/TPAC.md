## Agenda items

**Please note: the schedule as described on the w3 website is not correct**

The [TPAC schedule](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/TPAC/schedule.html) says that Thursday and Friday are full days for the WebAssembly Working Group, and there is a two-hour meeting on Tuesday for the Community Group. This is **not** correct.

Instead, Thursday and Friday will be full days of Community Group discussion. To attend, you must [complete the TPAC registration](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/TPAC/#registration), pay the registration fees, and be a Community Group member. You do not need to be a Working Group member to attend.

          - quick status update
          - 15 min
       1. [Host Bindings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings) (Luke Wagner)
          - Recap problem statement: direct calls to any Web IDL methods/accessors from wasm
          - Recap developments since TPAC last year: extraction of the Reference Types proposal
          - Short browser update on any browser implementation progress toward Reference Types
          - Given Reference Types, what's left for Host Bindings to do?
            - The following are still missing when calling Web IDL:
              - Pass/receive a non-undefined receiver
              - Call as a constructor
              - Opt into unsigned interpretation of i32/i64 when converting to Number/BigInt
              - Callbacks: function reference types + func.bind (+ WeakRefs)
            - With Reference Types factored out into the core spec, consider renaming to "Web IDL Bindings"?
          - Observation: the real value prop to use any of this (from browser POV) is fast Web IDL calls
          - So, proposal: let's define a milestone that combines Reference Types + Web IDL Bindings MVP
          - Some WebGL/Emscripten glue code can move into WASM bytecode; this will help fast Web IDL calls
          - How would this look in the source language?
            - Short recap of Rust wasm-bindgen
            - How would this look in other languages?  Is there an opportunity to share/regularize backend tools?
          - 1+ hour?
       1. [Garbage collection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) (Andreas Rossberg)
          - overview of current MVP proposal
          - 1+ hour?
    1. Closure
