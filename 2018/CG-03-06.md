### Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)

*JF volunteers*

### Adoption of the agenda

*Brad seconds*

### Proposals and discussions

#### Review of action items from prior meeting.

* [webappsec joint meeting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/175) Brad and Eric sorting out Google’s point of view first.
* [Layer 1 encoding](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/issues/174) Brad talked to tools folks, think it probably layers. No brotli chat yet.

#### Future in-person meeting

[Hosted by Fastly in San Francisco in April](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/2018/CG-04.md)

Let’s move forward with it.


#### Rename memory operations

*Ben Smith*

       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/627
       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/649 (short names)
       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/720 (long names)

*Postponed*


#### Annotation syntax for the text format

*Andreas Rossberg*

Provide generic notation to represent custom (section) information in text format

[gist](https://gist.github.com/rossberg/c0fa2e20d7614b128a9ffb5c5ab50dde)

**POLL:** We should create an `annotations` repo to hold a Phase 0 proposal to define annotation syntax for the text format.

*Unanimous consent*

*AI:* JF to create repo and tracking issue. Andreas to populate.


#### ES module integration

*Lin Clark*

       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1087
       * Discussion with webpack: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6433#issuecomment-363585102

[Slides](https://linclark.github.io/wasm-es-modules/slides/2018-03-06/#/0)[Slides with presenter notes](https://linclark.github.io/wasm-es-modules/slides/2018-03-06/#/0?presenter) 

* Brad: how do we cope with deciding how a module is being loaded? MIME type?
* Lin: yes. Byte-sniffing could also work.
* Andreas: why cycling linking?
* Lin: expect very close dependencies between JS and wasm. Acting as a wrapper. Also because ESM allows them, would be a stumbling block.
* Andreas: difference with wasm and JS is types. Might paint us in corner.

*POLL:* create a stage 0 proposal for ESM integration, with Lin as champion.

*Unanimous consent*

*AI:* JF to create repo, link tracking issue. Lin to fill repo.


#### WebAssembly BigInt integration

*Daniel Ehrenberg*

       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration
       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/707
       * Where should this be in the process?

* JavaScript has BigInt at stage 3. Shipping in Chrome soon. Being implemented for other browsers.
* Have spec text.
* Have some tests.
* Michael: which stage is this in TC39?
* 3.
* JF: I’d be uncomfortable in moving to WebAssembly stable if it weren’t in stage 4 for TC39. I don’t think we’ll be in that position.
* Dan: Note that other specs are making BigInt integrations already, e.g., HTML.

*POLL:* vote to move to [stage 2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/process/phases.md#2-proposed-spec-text-available-community--working-group).

*Unanimous consent*

*AI:* JF to update repo and tracking issue.


#### HTML serialization of WebAssembly.Module objects

*Daniel Ehrenberg*

       * https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/711
       * Where should this be in the process?

* Only issue encountered was Brad’s PR disallowed posting to other agent clusters, e.g. service workers. Should we lift it?
* Brad: was a restriction for SharedArrayBuffer. Trying to mimic.
* Dan: you can’t serialize SAB though.
* Brad: should be at least available in same places. No objection to having more.
* Dan: previous spec also prevented IDB storage from HTTP, only allowed HTTPS.
* Brad: I think for Chrome we’ll restrict this.
* JF: I’d rather add restrictions in well thought-out manner, not ad-hoc.
* Dan: this proposal was left out of the JS Web API specification by accident.
* JF: not editorial change, so this affects first working draft.
* Michael: we don’t do IDB at all right now.

*Continue next meeting*
