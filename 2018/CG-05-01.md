## Agenda items

1. Opening, welcome and roll call
    1. Opening of the meeting
    1. Introduction of attendees
1. Find volunteers for note taking (acting chair to volunteer)
1. Adoption of the agenda
1. Proposals and discussions
    1. Review of action items from prior meeting.
    1. [Notes from the in-person meeting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/2018/CG-04.md) are now online.
    1. Proposal for a WebAssembly CG co-chair (JF Bastien presenting)
        1. Propose that Ben Smith be co-chair of the WebAssembly CG.
        1. Why have a co-chair?
            1. Frees up some of my time.
            1. Reduces turnaround for procedural CG things.
            1. Enables someone else to act as a clear leader of the CG.
            1. Helpful to have someone else acting as an official facilitator for sub-groups.
            1. Allows me to more cleanly represent a biased point-of-view when I want to by explicitly yielding the role of facilitator to the co-chair when I want to stop being impartial for a bit.
        1. [The CG charter](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/) allows me to unilaterally choose a co-chair. However, I’d rather have the CG take a straw poll.
        1. Why Ben? He’s been involved very early in WebAssembly, has stayed on top of most design / spec work, is leading some new features, he’s a very capable communicator, and he’s level-headed so I think he’d be able to play the role of an impartial facilitator.
        1. POLL: support Ben Smith of Google as co-chair of the WebAssembly CG.
    1. POLL: Change `WebAssembly.Global` constructor to take value as second argument.
        1. i.e. `new WebAssembly.Global({type, mutable}, value);`
        1. This was discussed briefly in the April CG meeting, but there was no official poll taken.
1. Closure

## `WebAssembly.Global` constructor

*Ben Smith presenting*

`WebAssembly.Global` constructor should take value as second argument.

i.e. `new WebAssembly.Global({type, mutable}, value);`

This was discussed briefly in the April CG meeting, but there was no official poll taken.

**POLL:** Change `WebAssembly.Global` constructor to take value as second argument.
