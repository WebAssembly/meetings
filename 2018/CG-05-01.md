    1. [Notes from the in-person meeting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/2018/CG-04.md) are now online.
    1. Proposal for a WebAssembly CG co-chair (JF Bastien presenting)
        1. Propose that Ben Smith be co-chair of the WebAssembly CG.
        1. Why have a co-chair?
            1. Frees up some of my time.
            1. Reduces turnaround for procedural CG things.
            1. Enables someone else to act as a clear leader of the CG.
            1. Helpful to have someone else acting as an official facilitator for sub-groups.
            1. Allows me to more cleanly represent a biased point-of-view when I want to by explicitly yielding the role of facilitator to the co-chair when I want to stop being impartial for a bit.
        1. [The CG charter](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/) allows me to unilaterally choose a co-chair. However, I’d rather have the CG take a straw poll.
        1. Why Ben? He’s been involved very early in WebAssembly, has stayed on top of most design / spec work, is leading some new features, he’s a very capable communicator, and he’s level-headed so I think he’d be able to play the role of an impartial facilitator.
        1. POLL: support Ben Smith of Google as co-chair of the WebAssembly CG.
    1. POLL: Change `WebAssembly.Global` constructor to take value as second argument.
        1. i.e. `new WebAssembly.Global({type, mutable}, value);`
        1. This was discussed briefly in the April CG meeting, but there was no official poll taken.
1. Closure
