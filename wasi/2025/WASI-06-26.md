### Add native getter & setter support to WIT

**Dave Bakker**: Opened an issue on the component model repo a while back for getters and setters. Many languages have either a dedicated syntax or they have strong opinions on what getters and setters should look like. WIT only has methods. There is no strong consensus on what the convention should be. Some use get- prefix. Others use prefix-less variants. On the getter side, there isn’t a strong consensus. At least on the setter there is a consistent way.

The downside is that non-idiomatic bindings for getters and setters. For example in C#, you would want something like a KeepAliveEnabled {get; set;}. Instead today you have KeepAliveEnabled() and SetKeepAliveEnabled(). One challenge is that the bindings generators cannot automatically infer the method.

For example, request: func(), is it a request or does it perform a request?

In the case of get-request, does it get a request object or does it obtain an HTTP GET request object.

Proposal: add native syntax to WIT.

Going from what we have today: my-prop: func() or get-my-prop: func(), then the new way is my-prop: get() and my-prop: set(value).

Suggest adding to the square bracket resource on the existing ABI. Some basic rules, getters can not be marked async. Similarly the setter may not be marked async either. It must return either nothing or the result type. 

In the case of the getter and setter are defined for the same name, ensure that the getter and setter in the generated bindings have the same type.

This is already working in a prototype. In terms of a migration plan, we keep what we have today in 0.2.0. Before 0.3.0, add a get-* prefix to all getter-like methods. To free up the unprefixed name in prep for the next step.

In 0.3.x, add get/set syntax to the C/M. Add properties next to the existing WASI interfaces. Deprecate the existing get-*/set-* methods. 

The goal to get consensus today is to align on the adding the prefix to all getters. Is it OK if I open PR’s today to prefix all getters.

**Yosh**: Speaking for myself personally, I am in favor. I was not aware that we were not already consistent, and seems like a very reasonable approach for consistency. Even better is that it opens the door for adding properties in the future. Makes sense to me.

**Luke**: +1, great presentation and overview. I’m in favor.

**Joel**: Is fallable getters and setters something allowed? 

**Dave**: Most of the languages use exceptions for fallibility. 

**Joel**: I wasn’t sure if there was some odd language that might be tripped up by that but sounds reasonable to me. The consensus for fallible constructors went the other way.

**Luke**: Oh we might not have thought about that yet and hasn’t reached the front of the priority queue.

**Bailey**: Procedurally, please feel free to file PR’s. Work with the proposal champions to align the API and merge.

### WASI 0.3 June Update

**Yosh**: This is the June Update for 0.3. The May update was on May 1st. This is the last possible update point for June but I was out sick. 

Good news, we’re very much on track.

Estimates may change, as they are estimates. Now, if they change, they are likely to change for the better and unlikely to change for the worse. Unexpected things might happen but unknown/unknowns are mostly gone.

Stakeholder milestones. Ready for demos April 2025. This was done. Ready for integration, this is new this time around. I want to officially give the start sign that you are a vendor. If you are interested in P3, now is a good time to begin the process of integrating into your product. Things are not stable to the degree to declare stability, but if you care about giving feedback and launching as soon as p3 is ready, then begin that process now. Feedback is very helpful. The long tail of this will be dependent on feedback. At every stage we’re looking for a degree of confidence to say we’re ready to move forward. The more vendors and teams have experience using this, the more confidence we can have. Now is the time for integration.

In terms of implementation milestones, there are 8 total milestones. Back in December of last year that Joel made with the help of others, we had a Host and guest POC. The wasmtime host draft implementation in April, the bindings were stable modulo any spec changes. The component spec has no open questions. Cancellation was the biggest one that we had to add (collective we, Luke, Alex, Joel, and more). 

We are working on the wasmtime host implementation and JCO implementation to have the second reference implementation. For wasmtime, we expect this to be upstreamed sometime in August. Alex announced that upstreaming has begun. The upstreaming repo is a fork for wasmtime it was used to iterate on the spec. All of the unsafe code involved there has now been brought into an understandable and verifiable way. This will be a series of 4 PR’s. The first is to bring in the fiber implementation. Review needs to go into every single bit is maintainable in the long term. Once fibers have landed, the next step will be to bring over all of the refactorings to the external API’s. This will include everything but the async abstractions. This will also take a bit of time for review. Then the third out of 4 PR’s will bring over the concurrent bits. A lot of the work has gone on to verify everything and has been “rubber stamped”. The final PR will be to bring over all of the tests. The final two PR’s will be a lot easier and have already undergone a lot of review.

Once that is done, we are not done yet. Next is the implementation with the WASIP3 API’s. Some feedback and time to back will be needed there. Expecting a longer tail there. In terms of complexity, these are some of the very hardest bits are done to implement the async model of the CM. So it’s not just these 4 PR’s, but it will be significantly less difficult and be more parallelizable. At some point in August, this should all be done.

We expect that upstream vendors may want to begin cautiously putting out their previews. It’s meant to be a workable thing that people can use. 

JCO is also progressing really well. August for wasmtime, JCO is a little further behind that. A lot of the changes happened to the spec a couple months ago. That meant that for a while JCO was trying to keep up then decided to pause and wait for the spec to stabilize. Happy to share that things are now progressing really well. In terms of implementation and tests, the shim and actual bindings will be linked up together to allow end to end tests to run. At which point, the wasmtime tests can be brought over. 

We now have Component Model spec tests that have now been handrolled in a suite of tests by Luke in WAST. JCO and others can bring these over to verify that all of the interactions and edge cases are covered for the Component Model. This will be a major milestone for the implementation, this is not to say that it will be done. October is a safe estimate for when the end to end tests and everything will be implemented.

We’re not late on anything as far as we can tell. If you are a vendor, I want to give the clear start signal to go forth and begin implementing.

**Joel (in chat)**: All 4 PRs are posted; currently iterating on the first one prior to merging.

**Yosh**: Thank you for that elaboration Joel, that’s very helpful.
