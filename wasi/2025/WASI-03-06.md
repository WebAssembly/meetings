### WASI 0.3 progress update

**Yosh**: What is WASI 0.3? In a nutshell, wasi 0.3 gives us async. The main interface for giving async today is through the pollable interface. It is our unit of asynchrony. The resource pollable, and you want to wait, you get these pollables and stick them in a list. If you’ve ever used e-poll, it is very similar to that. Lists of things we wait on and a central system call.

**Yosh**: In the clocks package, there is a subscribe-duration function that returns a pollable. This is the basic shape.

**Yosh**: wasi:io is depended on by pretty much every other wasi proposal [shows graph in slides of proposals].

**Yosh**: The idea of components is that you can compose them but in 0.2 you can only easily compose with the sync subset. In 0.3, we remove wasi:io and asynchrony is no longer a wasi interface. The async behavior is now in the stream and future types in the Component Model. 

**Yosh**: HTTP only pulls in the stdio and stdout of wasi:cli. For 1.0, we want to make a breaking change to remove this but this is not in scope for 0.3. This would remove the dep on wasi:cli for http and simplifies this.

**Yosh**: Once we remove pollable, in practice it looks like this: `subscribe-duration: func(how-long: duration)`. This demonstrates the colorless-ness of the async functions.

**Yosh**: In a nutshell, this is the nature of what these changes are. We’ve run through all of the WASI API’s and removed the pollable interfaces. 

**Yosh**: In terms of milestones and progress, we’ve hit several now but let’s break them down. 1. Prove it’s feasible to add native async support to the component model. This has largely been driven by Joel Dice. Joel experimented in his own repo and proved the feasibility with Luke.

**Yosh**: The second phase is to write the specification for it and upstream it to the component model repo.

**Yosh**: The updated versions of the existing phase 3 WASI interfaces to show that it is possible to remove the stream interfaces. 

**Yosh**: Changes are expected to continue to happen based on feedback from implementers. All of the work has been completed and now it’s clarifications/feedback. Milestones 1, 2, and 3 have completed.

**Joel Dice (in chat)**: There are more post-0.3.0 spec additions planned

**Yosh**: 4) Guest binding generation support for Rust comes first. This binding support is complete. Next 5) implement host support for async and WASI 0.3 in Wasmtime. Implementation is now driving the development of the specification right now. 6) Implementation of host support for async and WASI 0.3 in JCO.

**Yosh**: There is now a fork of the wasmtime repo with the purpose of doing a full implementation and once it is proven, then it will be upstreamed back into wasmtime proper. This ensures that behind a gate, this can be enabled. The bulk of all WASI API’s have now been implemented.

**Yosh**: Now in JCO, sync or async implementations on either side, in order to support this, an implementation for this has landed in the form of JSPI. JCO is the JS component host implementation. In order to do some JS calls, it needs to do some transforms. The JavaScript Promise API (JSPI) does some of this translation. This has now landed (it took about 9 months) and has now landed. On one side, there is a shim to ensure that things work well. On the other we’re expecting to have an end to end prototype to see this working. We’re not quite there in the integration of these two in the middle.

**Joel Dice (in chat)**: Victor has a simple async export test case passing on Jco. (Lots more to do, of course)

**Yosh**: What I’m describing here is the first version here. There will be a longer tail here to have this bake. 

**Yosh**: The last 7th step is to fuzz and test to uncover any blind spots in the specs and implementations. There will be a long tail there.

**Yosh**: The first conceptual milestone is that we’re now ready for demos.

**Bailey (in chat)**: Roman demo'd a wasip3 component over wasi:sockets at a meetup last night

**Yosh**: Ready for integration for toolchain authors who are ready to see if this works for their language and semantics. This largely depends on the fork of wasmtime being merged in. This will allow language authors to have a runtime to target behind a feature flag.

**Yosh**: Ready and stable for moving through the WASI SG. This will take some longer time whereas the others are in a matter of weeks.

**Max Seidler**: There is no async keyword or anything you showed in your code? Is there nothing that will declare your functions as async?

**Luke Wagner**: Yosh is right that we don’t have colors. For language binding, it is useful to hint to the generator. Without hints, it will all either be async or sync. We do now have hints, you will now see @async func. It’s a hint not a color. 

**Colin Murphy**: https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Async.md

**Yosh**: Do we need to update the interfaces?

**Joel**: Yes we probably need to.

**Chris Suszynski**: This looks great and looks like now might be the right time to invest in documentation. 

**Yosh**: Yes, this sounds like a great idea. Anyone from SIG-Docs here?

**Kate**: Yes, this would be a great thing to put in as an issue and track for the new types of things we can build with P3.

**Alex (in chat)**: Yeah  async  got released to  wasm-tools  yesterday, so very very fresh

**Yosh**: So many people have directly and indirectly have helped with this.

**Merlijn**: What is the host component implementation of a function look like?

**Joel**: It’s a little bit tricky so I won’t go into too much detail here. Rust has the ability to add syntactic sugar to async functions. Any concurrent async functions will be `async` functions in rust. That store in wasmtime without any locks involved, with cooperative concurrency, is that you would have mutable access to that store. Like writing to streams and all these things that involve the store. When we are generating the host bindings for an async func that is designed to be concurrent. If it has access to the store across an await point, in the borrow-checker of Rust, we had to be very careful that the future does not monopolize the store. We came up with an API that looks similar to thread locals in rust. We came up with a way that you have access to the store through async but not through wait points.

**Joel**: Checkout the link here for the WASIP3 impl that Roman has worked on: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasip3-prototyping

**Colin**: Where is the work happening? Wasmtime, wit-bindgen, or the wasi crate.

**Joel**: People are using this now whether they should be are not. You can try it now but just be ready that things are changing. On the guest side, they’ve all been upstreamed to wit-bindgen and wasm-tools. Things are changing and you’ll see that in wasip3-prototyping that I am now in the midst of merging spec changes. You must have wasm-tools, wasip3-prototyping, and wit-bindgen aligned to the version that is referenced in that repo. 

**Yosh**: This maps back to the stabilization stages. I plan to provide updates like today to call out when now is a good time to begin. If you’re an enthusiast, right now go for it, but not the time for folks that need stability.

**Alex**: This is a fantastic time if you are an embedder planning to use async. If you have a lot of invested interest, now is a fantastic time to get involved. If you are looking with an eye towards ensuring this works for your runtime. It’s only going to get harder to change the spec from here on out.

### wasi-digital-io and wasi-spi

**Jarno**: Master student at Ghent University. For my masters thesis, I am working on wasi-digital-io and wasi-spi. 

**Merlijn Sebrechts (imec)** Initial proposal for WASI GPIO API: https://github.com/idlab-discover/masters-jarno-vanruymbeke/blob/main/wit/gpio.wit

**Merlijn**: For more context, there is already a proposal for digital-io. Our proposal is to take this over and to rename it to GPIO. This is a very common term for these kinds of API’s in the embedded world. We want to support analog and digital for these pins. This proposal supports both.

**Jarno**: This is the API. I started by looking at different ways projects work with GPIO. I looked at the Arduino api which is very basic and doesn’t have error handling. I looked further into the ESP family of chips, which has more error handling and configuration. Rust also has several crates for GPIO. I specified the type for a pin number as u8. Then I looked at what could happen when something happened as an error as various error types. The digital pin can be in one of two states; high or low. I met with SIG-Embedded on Tuesday, and was asked to potentially rename this, e.g. active-low or active-hight. You can set the state or use the function to turn it high or low. There are a few additional functions that represent blocking functions that allow you to let the guest pause. This is interesting to add because this prevents the guest from needing to check every few ms. 

**Merlijn**: The blocking functions are placeholders. With wasip3, we intend to make these async functions. We don’t expect to standardize these functions before wasip3.

**Jarno**: There is also an analog interface which is basically a translation from the digital world to analog. I chose to let the function accept a u16 because on the arduino side it has this resolution. I assume this will be enough for most boards.

**Jarno**: There aren’t many high resolution digital to analog converters that are well known. It has the equivalent blocking functions. It will unblock the guest once the state is reached.

**Jarno**: Now the pin will be requested by the constructor as a u8. The problem is that certain pin numbers cannot be mapped directly to the pin number itself. For example, on a Raspberry Pi, the GPIO 2 pin is pin 3. That might not be that clear for the developer. I can add an API to make this easier.

**Merlijn**: During the embedded meeting earlier this week, we discussed the idea of labelling pins at length. We might not be able to do this well with the current WIT standard. Which specific pins it translates to is something only the board knows. It would be useful for components to statically describe the specific sensor identification it wants to connect to, and then the board knows which sensor is connected to which pin and makes the translation. Alternatively, you could have something like “devicetree” for these kind of sensors. That would be an API where the wasm workload can query available sensors and choose one. We don’t yet know what the best approach is, but regardless, our proposed GPIO API works very well without this additional mapping functionality. Right now the application just needs to know specifically which pin it needs to talk to.

**Jarno**: Merlijn discussed becoming a champion of this proposal.

**Max Seidler**: I was part of the embedded SIG on Tuesday. I prepared a document as feedback, but I did it right before this meeting. Sorry guys. I will highlight the most important. We already discussed the change from “high” and “low” to “active” and “inactive. I also proposed a few more error codes. The more important things are that we add flags to pass to the driver which sits below the GPIO level.

**Max Seidler**: The blocking things are quite interesting and will likely be async. I haven’t seen this flow in C/C++. In C++, I’m more used to callbacks.

**Bailey (in chat)**: Pollables are basically callbacks.

**Max**: I’m not sure what the idea is of the value in the analog API. Is this the max voltage that you can set?

**Jarno**: I chose 16 bit because it is the smallest data type. It is the upper 12 bits. If you go over that, there will be a max voltage. The 4 bits would be the max voltage.

**Bailey** WIT supports doc comments. It’s better to turn these comments in the WIT file into doc comments.

**Max**: Why are there different constructors and different types for reading and writing to pins?

**Jarno**: Wasmtime or another runtime can allow/deny access to certain pins, or could only allow read or write access. If you allow a pin to be an input/output, you call the constructor for that pin, and the runtime will give you that handle. Otherwise, it will return an error.

**Max**: Technically you can set a pin to be both as an input and an output.

**Jarno**: Ok maybe I need to create a new resource that allows it to be both, input and output. I know embedded HAL as one of those pins but then I would need the equivalent for analog.

**Jarno**: About the flags in the constructor. 

**Max**: These are flags to be passed to the driver. In very rare cases, there must be more done than the GPIO that is attached to the core of the chip. Sometimes you have GPIO controllers with two banks, you need to switch and/or configure them at runtime. Applications have to tell which of the banks are used.

**Jarno**: I will need to use a separate board.

**Dan Gohman**: Should this configuration be done by the application, or should it be exposed through the host environment?

**Jarno**: The first version I showed had more configuration, but we decided to remove it. Merlijn, can you give more info?

**Merlijn**: We make the distinction between stuff that we expect to not change throughout the lifetime of the device, versus stuff that we expect to change throughout the lifetime of the device. If we expect it to change, it should be configurable by the app, if not, it can just be baked into the runtime/host image. In the case of the banks, I understand that this is something that can change throughout the lifetime of the app, so we need to expose it to applications.

**Stephen**: There is always a trade-off between what you want to allow and there is no limit to weird hardware out there. Somewhere else in our hardware platform, we have to add a mapping to all of the devices. It depends on how much control is really needed. Switching the configuration of the bank would not work for how we approach this.

**Thomas Trenner**: How much information should a wit file contain? What is the system boundary of a WIT component? Sometimes you need to know where to drop your wasm file. On which device the wasm file should run. Which sensors should be attached to it? It would be useful to have a way to describe this in metadata: “this workload expects the device to have these properties/sensors/..”.

**Bailey**: Checkout WebAssembly/tool-conventions and using custom metadata to describe the nature of the component.
