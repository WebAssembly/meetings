### 0.3 C-M spec status

**Luke Wagner**: Spec work update. There has been a lot of implementation work and implementations found lots of great fixes and found issues when creating bindings. There is one open PR for the ability to do zero length read or write (#444). Needed for implementing libc non-blocking operations. This is the proposed solution. We want to see this implemented before deciding this is the right way to solve this problem.

**Luke**: A remaining TODO is subtask.cancel #495. We can them subtasks as things that are in the table of waitables. Subtask.cancel given an async import. It’s not a brutal, so the cancel gives it an event to wrap quickly (co-operative cancel). We’re working on both the spec and impl for this one.

**Luke**: It seems like things are starting to quiet down on the spec side of things. Some important things to scope down 0.3 down as much as we can. The rest is punted to 0.3.x to additive, regular releases. One example is the same-instance streams (#475). When reader and writer are in the same component, it can overwrite the alias and could do an optimization so right we trap in this case.

**Luke**: Another is cross-task synchronization (#459). We’re sketching out something similar to what we already see in the browser with atomics.wait. 

**Luke**: Zero-copy stream splicing (and other wasi:io/streams optimized methods). Optimizations we want to make here but not in 0.3.0.

**Luke**: error-context (#489) / stream<T, U, E> (co-design together). We need to improve stream to express the error case for the final value. These all need to co-design together. Right now we do the following pattern: a tuple of the stream with a future and an error specific to the interface. For now we’re doing this slightly gross wit type.

**Roman (in chat)**: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/blob/d163277b8684483a2334363ca1492ca298ea526d/wit-0.3.0-draft/types.wit#L431

**Luke**: Cooperative threads with thread.spawn_indirect. High priority but punted from 0.3.0. I gave a talk about this at Wasm I/O.

**Joel Dice**: Cooperative threads is an umbrella for stackful async.

**Luke**: We want stackful coroutines, so not valuable until we have these cooperative threads.

### 0.3 wasmtime and wasm-tools implementation status

**Joel Dice**: Starting with wasm-tools, this is pretty much done modulo any spec changes. We’re a bit ahead of the spec with an implementation for subtask.cancel. You can parse, encode, print components with wasm-tools. It could use more fuzzing and test coverage but otherwise pretty much done. Don’t expect a lot of churn before we release there unless the spec changes substantially which we don’t expect.

**Joel**: In wit-bindgen we still need to do task cancellation. One weakness that we have right now is that we don’t have runtime tests in CI. We want the tests to be upstreamed into wasmtime first. We’re using the wasmtime-protopying repo which is a temporary fork of wasmtime that we’re working with. 

**Joel**: We want the spec to fully stabilize so that we don’t have to churn across multiple languages. We’ve focused on rust up to now. We’re expecting C to be first now. 

**Joel**: We have deferred stackful async that we know go will want to use eventually. Right now tinygo uses asyncify and will continue to be the case in 0.3.0. So right now its about implement P3 on top of the existing infra there. Post-0.3.0 we will want to work on stackful async for tinygo which is specifically designed for coroutines.

**Joel**: For JCO, I don’t have it on here as I’m a little out of the loop on that one. We’re focusing on getting wasmtime solid before dedicating significant support to jco.

**Joel**: In wasmtime, we almost have complete 0.3.0 async support. We do need to implement the zero-length reads and writes. We need a lot more tests and fuzzing. The code state needs some refactors as it bears the scars of many spec changes like moving from waitables to waitable sets. It needs to be holistically reevaluated which we can do once we have a solid base of tests so that we can do this refactor fearlessly.

**Joel**: We’re aiming to get the prototyping fork upstreamed by August in time for the September release. Roman will talk more about wasi crates and http.

**Joel**: wasi-libc and wasi-sdk will need wit-bindgen C generator async support. Right now using wasm32-wasip2 isn’t a big deal to use directing for p3 since it’s all sync anyways. In the future, native p3 will be really nice to convert from file descriptor to an input stream.

**Colin Murphy**: Once this lands, you can take input stream and convert to stream stream?

**Joel**: No that was an example of something we would be able to do once we have native p3. If you’re really going through wasi-libc, it’s going to be whatever your guest language filesystem implementation is. Then copy chunks in a loop. Once we have native support, I’m hoping that it will be more than just straight POSIX support like descriptors to async stream. 

**Colin**: Are you looking for help?

**Joel**: Checkout the prototyping repo. There’s a component async test crate. Look for any programs that start with async_ and you can see some interesting compositions and examples. Anything you’ve been looking for in wasip3, then please check it out and give feedback. Wit-bindgen c generator would be a great help as it would be the thing to unblock wasi-libc. Any help there is welcome. 

### wasi-http 0.3 update

**Roman**: There have been a few changes in wasi-http. My primary goal is to make it harder to cause a trap in the guest and simplify the host side implementation. As Luke already mentioned, there’s a future idiom that we want to use on the body method with a stream and future. For now however we have a tuple. 

**Roman**: In WASIP2, you would call finish on the outgoing body. This is when you would know something has failed during transmission. There is no guarantee that all of the bytes have been transmitted, but now in wasip3 we have an error on the handler. Additionally, it is now harder to cause a trap on the request by minimizing copies on the constructor and prevent the trap.

**Roman**: All of the wasi 0.3.0-draft API’s are all implemented in the prototyping repo. Now I can build client and server components. Using the prototyping repo of wasmtime, I can serve the component that I just built using wasmtime serve.

(shows example source code from https://github.com/rvolosatovs/p3-http-test)

**Roman**: Very bleeding edge so you need to make sure you match all of the tooling to make things work but it’s getting more stable over time. 

**Bailey Hayes**: Thank you for the update Luke, Joel, and Roman. Key takeaway that I heard is that the spec in Component Model, wasi 0.3-drafts, and the implementations are ready for feedback. Reiterating the call to action from Joel, a good place to start is reviewing the async_ tests in the wasmtime wasip3 prototyping repo at https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasip3-prototyping.
