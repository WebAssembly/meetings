### Normalizing Wasm Proposal Repos (Yosh)

**Yosh**: We ran another wasi 0.3.0 rc release two days ago. We were hoping it would be 10 minutes but instead 10 hours. This was an opportunity to reflect on the process and make it better. While we run the release, we do not actually own the proposals. We take the .wit’s, compile them down to .wasm, then upload to GitHub’s registry. We rev all the versions but the actual proposal repos, we don’t own those. Four things to discuss.

First thing we noticed, on the 0.3.0 sub directories, we’re not running CI consistently. For at least one proposal, the WIT didn’t compile. We should probably have some form of CI for the rc/draft proposals. 

**Bailey**: We were relying on wit-abi-up-to-date, but don’t want to use this to generate md’s for 0.3. We propose using `wkg wit build` instead for this CI.

**Yosh**: That’s the first. The second one that we ran into is that we currently have different merge strategies for various proposals. Part of what we do for the release is that we create a PR with a patch. Once that patch merges, we then kick-off a release. We currently have a four tiered merge attempt and finally throw an error if it doesn’t work. It would be nice if we could agree on a merge strategy so that things are consistent and the same maintainability standards apply across all of our proposals. Some folks have raised that they think it should be rebase based.

**Yosh**: The third one is that we ran into another bug where the main branches was actually broken. In some repos we allow push to main, that didn’t happen but we do see the warnings. Another one is that we did not require CI to pass before merging. Someone filed a patch, hit approve, hit merge before CI, and CI ended up failing after. While we releasing, the CI was failing for the CI that was failing. It added confusion thinking it was the patch PR but it was actually the main branch that was failing. Preventing merges before CI is green would resolve this. Related to that, we want to enable the use of auto-merge. For folks unfamiliar, we want to use a github feature that allows a PR to merge after CI passes. I would like to propose that we lock down pushing to the main branch and then require CI to pass before merge happens.

**Lann**: Just took on co-championing wasi-cli. Does anyone actually feel like you should not own the mechanics of the repo? Does anyone feel like they need to control how their WIT is being packaged. If I was in your position, I would just do it and then ask for forgiveness.

**Till (in chat)**: I would've made that same point: strongly agreed that the chairs should be allowed to make these kinds of changes without running it by the committee

**Andy**: decide :)

**Yosh**: I don’t want to unilaterally decide. But great, ok this sounds good. We are deciding that we will lock these down. Yes we need CI for all draft proposals, yes we need a merge strategy. Let’s rephrase that. Does anyone have objections to the merge strategies proposed, rebase. Please reach out and otherwise we can talk about it. 

**Lann**: The most controversial of merge strategies

**Yosh**: I have no opinions. We could open up an issue and settle on something.

**Yosh**: The final one. For 0.3.0 proper, we want to move off of our current release method. For 0.2 and 0.3 rc’s, we are publishing packages to the main WebAssembly org. The way you can do packages with the org or for an individual repositories. The releases are not linked to the repos but to the main org. That requires someone to issue a token that we use to run releases with. If you go to any of the actual repos, you don’t see the package associated with the release. For 0.3 proper, we want to move away from that strategy. We will likely need to do some transition there. Move it over and see what breaks. 

**Lann**: Talk to me, I designed the current version of wkg.

**Bailey**: Just comes down to the change in URI, from wasi/ to wasi- for the proposals. 

**Yosh**: We now have a single script to fire off. All of this is to make sure releases happen quickly and easily. Since we’re not hearing any concerns, we will go ahead and make the changes.
