### WASI release process updates

**Yosh**: I submitted these items last week assuming that these would be done over the next week. I hoped to be able to happily report that this was updated, but we’re going to move this to next WASI meeting.

**Yosh**: Next Tuesday we will cut the next WASIP2 patch release. We are also expecting to update release candidates for 0.3.

### WASI 0.3

**Yosh**: We started giving these updates I think in June. We are beyond our milestones so I am going to share our highlights. Starting with Wasmtime, v37.0.0 is now out and if you want to try out WASI 0.3. In order to call it you have to pass in the wasip3 flag and the component-model-async flags. This uses the latest rc we published three weeks ago. In order to build this, you need a few custom build instructions. 

**Yosh**: See the Makefile in Joel’s hello-wasip3-http in his example. I recommend looking at that for trying this out for the first time. This is end to end.

**Yosh**: In terms of actions items for wasmtime. Wasmtime 37 has been released with a preview in there. That doesn’t mean everything is done yet. The focus on Wasmtime is on testing and refactoring. 

**Colin**: The reason that you have to go to p1 is that the adapter can only go from p1. I have a lot of things but they require p2. 

**Joel**: The main thing is that the rust target for cargo did not have a recent enough wasm-ld in order to recognize async intrinsics, etc. Nightly is now updated so hopefully there will be an upcoming stable, and you won’t have to go through this rigmarole.

**Colin**: So the latest or nearly latest should work?

**Joel**: yes

**Yosh**: In terms of priorities for Wasmtime right now is refactorings. One example of not yet being done is fuzzing. There are additional tests being ported. This will likely be ongoing for the next little bit. It means that all of the functionality has and landed and is being implemented. If you find any bugs, please report them. That is the main focus for the work right now.

**Yosh**: Rust toolchain fun update. This is not part of the acceptance criteria for WASIP3, but want to share the update. We have a PR up to add the wasm32-wasip3 target to Rust. We asked in the June all hands for Rust if it’s ok to go ahead and add this target before it has stabilized and they agreed that would be OK. Once this PR lands you will be able to do this on nightly and use the `cfg` to select it. Allows various SDKs to work on p2 and p3. target_env = “p3” will be the flag.

**Yosh**: The final update on JCO. As of this morning 69  of 79 components are passing. There is more work. Victor is making good progress here. There are essentially two or maybe three cases need to be fixed before the next major update.
  
**Victor**: It’s actually 59 of 69 but close enough, same diff.

**Yosh**: Our goal has been voting in the WASI SG meeting in November. The last meeting in November falls on the 27th. This would help it make it into the December release train. The next release train would be February release train. We’re still feeling good this a good target. Questions or comments?
