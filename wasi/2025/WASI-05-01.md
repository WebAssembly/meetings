### 0.3.0 Update

**Yosh Wyuts**: Update on WASI 0.3.0 and how it’s going. I attended a month ago, and was on leave two weeks ago during the update from Wasmtime implementers. I want to refine what was covered then and provide a rolling update including a future June update.

**Yosh**: Quick disclaimer before going in. This is an estimate, and so things that are closer we’re more sure about and times further away, less sure about.

**Yosh**: When can I use 0.3.0 as a stakeholder? The broad timelines that you can expect for this is based of this is from a previous presentation that I gave. We’re ready for demos now, at Wasm I/O we saw a few. 

**Yosh**: Ready for integration in May 2025. This is the starting shot for stakeholders for groups that build their products on top of wasmtime. Not to say wasmtime is done or ready, but if you have a stake in this and care about 0.3.0, things will have settled down enough for that. 

**Bailey (in chat)**: And embedder feedback is now invaluable

**Yosh**: The sooner you are able to provide feedback the sooner/easier it is to make changes.

**Yosh**: The third milestone is ready for previews in August 2025. We expect that embedders may want to give previews of WASI 0.3.0. Likely with wasmtime which is the furthest along in implementation. The WASI API’s themselves at this time are still subject to change. 

**Yosh**: The earliest that we expect WASI 0.3.0 to be ready and done is November 2025. We’re least sure about this deadline as the further out we are, the more variance there will be. 

**Yosh**: The second part of this is implementation milestones. We started sometime mid last year and completed a host and guest POC at the end of last year. The wasmtime host draft implementation in wasip3-prototyping repo. A full implementation exists and is done. This is not an upstreamed version of wasmtime, but a full end to end implementation. One of the things that we discovered is that we do need cancellation in 0.3.0 in the Component Model spec and cannot push it out to a later 0.3.x release. So now we know the scope is correct and have the confidence that this work is feasible. 

**Yosh**: Rust guest bindings. If you are writing rust and you want to target 0.3.0, you can do this now. Note that this is not a stable spec and so this can change. That is true up to the point that the WASI SG votes on the spec. In broad strokes, all of the features have been implemented. Alex has gone through all of the features with a fine-toothed comb so to speak. 

**Yosh**: Continuing on fine-grained milestones is the Component spec. The component spec is just about done in terms of major features. The last major feature is subtask.cancellation and the PR for that is now merged. Outside of major features that we know of, it is done. One other minor feature in flight is zero-length lists.

**Yosh**: The current work that is happening for the next milestone is moving to upstream the work that happened in the wasmtime prototyping repo into the high standards that wasmtime has. This work is expected to finish by August. This corresponds to the point that we are willing to say that this is the time for embedders to release a preview.

**Yosh**: JCO host bindings will be tailing behind the wasmtime bindings. We tried to get a headstart on co-developing wasmtime and jco at the same time. Because of cancellation and waitable sets and other features, there was significant churn. The second implementation needs to tail behind the first exploratory implementation. We have two people working on it, Tomasz from Microsoft and Victor from Cosmonic.

**Yosh**: Now that the spec is mostly done, JCO is now in a better position to take that and implement it. Hopefully there will be a lot less churn now and expect it to tail behind wasmtime.

**Yosh**: The vote with two reference implementations is expected to happen after that in November. We have the least clarity on JCO so this is dependent on that.

**Yosh**: Ready of integration in about two weeks. 

**Bailey**: If you are a guest language binding implementer, when is the right time to get started?

**Yosh**: The C guest SDK has started. You can start now if you don’t depend on that. The spec was largely written by Luke, that has been done, and then Alex did this for Rust. Other languages should be able to tail that implementation. 

**Joel**: Go is an interesting case. TinyGo relies on the Asyncify transformation. Creating idiomatic bindings for go, the ambitious work would be to make streams and futures look like go channels and be able to do goroutines with them. This is breaking new ground since Rust is using the async/await paradigm. The overall goal, is to support stackful async in which case the asyncify transformation from TinyGo would no longer be needed. If someone were super ambitious, then the prototyping repo does actually support this. I would be really interested if someone would be interested to get rid of Asyncify for Go. I would be interested in collaborating with that effort. 

**Bailey**: Just wanted to make sure we made the shout that other language bindings are ready to be implemented. Maybe question for Joel, are you aware folks working on other languages like C# and will they need the c binding work to be complete?

**Joel**: Timmy has started looking into that. It does interact with the C bindings so the .NET bindings to link with wasi-libc. It would be reasonable to get started without the c binding generator in place for C# but for completion, we will need the c binding generator as well.

**Yosh**: If you have any questions, we’re on the bytecode alliance zulip. I expect to do another one of these updates next month and will say more then.
