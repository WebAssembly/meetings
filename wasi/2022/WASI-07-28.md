### Wasi-logging proposal

- Dan Gohman
  - presented a bit ago
  - a logging API that will be used by stderr in wasi preview2
- sbc
  - does this mean stderr wouldn’t be a normal fd you could send a byte to at a time?
- Dan Gohman
  - yes but the rest of the posix semantics work (dup and so on)
- sbc
  - so stderr doesn’t depend on stream i/o?
  - can we do the same for stdout?
- Dan Gohman
  - yes. and some people want it for stdout. but looking ahead to that, as different use cases want different things for stdout (async or not, and so on). maybe typed main can let people specify
- sbc
  - maybe wasi-libc can implement the distinction
- Lin Clark
  - any objections? this is a consensus poll for advancing this to phase 1
  - no objections! Dan Gohman and I will figure out offline creating the repository for it and so on

###  Component Model async proposal (part 4: the thrilling, but brief, conclusion)

- Luke Wagner
  - deadlocks!
  - originally had “deadlock avoidance by construction” as a goal
  - but convinced myself it is impossible to avoid if you support tee and zip on streams
  - in general wasm cannot, and does not aim to, avoid resource exhaustion by design
  - instead, we specify that the engine can detect deadlocks, and trap
  - lazily and off the hot path
  - this condition is monotonic: once a deadlock occurs, it will persist
  - rather than hang, we could offer a fallible canon wait to allow callers to opt in to grateful handling
  - recap, some possible post MVP additions
- Mossaka
  - what are your thoughts on actor models?
- Luke Wagner
  - maybe one answer is it goes back to process models, which this is not
- Petr Penzin
  - wondering about tension between coroutine performance and cross-language concurrency
- Luke Wagner
  - a lot of languages that have have coroutines also have streams and futures, or something like them
- sbc
  - thinking of epoll, is there a way to wait on several streams at once?
- Luke Wagner
  - when you call wait, you’re waiting on a task and all its subtasks. so an implementation technique could be making an epoll task which has each thing as a subtask
- Mossaka
  - is this orthogonal to stack switching?
- Luke Wagner
  - I see it as layered on top, and as something that’ll help some implementations. and the proposal is making a lot of progress in the last month
- sbc
  - could use asyncify before stack switching is available
- George Kulakowski
  - questions about the fidelity of epoll emulation
- Luke Wagner
  - probably, and moreso if you accept some runtime cost
- Petr Penzin
  - those edge cases are kind of important, but not possible to enumerate every possible use. and performance degradation can really mess up adoption.
- Luke Wagner
  - for really high concurrency, suspect that’ll move into the host
