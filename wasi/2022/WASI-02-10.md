### : WASI-Networking

**Dave Bakker:** I’ve been working on proposal for bringing networking to WASI. Quick agenda, goal is to bring people up to speed, some of the challenges, possibly discuss some next steps to take. 

Code snippets will be in Rust. Assume a basic knowledge of BSD sockets. Some of the goals: start with an MVP for TCP. POSIX compatibility should be possible on top of the proposal, but the proposal itself is not.

BSD socket interface is highly generic. Solution, inspired by Lin’s initial comment, is to provide one function that can be called on one kind of socket and push all socket functions into protocol-specific modules. This enables every socket function signature to be tailored to the protocol. Each protocol can be a stand-alone WASI module. One con is that not all functions differ per protocol, but they are currently duplicated.

**Dan Gohman:** Do you envision separation being along address type or socket type? 

**Dave Bakker:** Currently split along TCP and UDP. Can also envision proposal for datagrams, doesn’t need to be socket protocol but also subprotocol.

Currently imagine it that it will be based on socket protocol, although if you follow you need a separate module for Unix socket, then another for streaming UNIX sockets, another datagram UNIX sockets.

**Dan Gohman:** Does that mean different for IPv4 vs IPv6

**Dave Bakker:** Yes, could, currently an enum

Not all functions differ per protocol, so results in libc having many switch statements. 

Security, idea is to have a capability handle. To create a socket you need to have a capability handle of some kind. On top of that, having possession of a capability handle should not give you keys to the kingdom. Proposal does not currently dictate how this happens. One can imagine effectively building a firewall. This is imagined to be command line argument of Wasmtime. You can simply allow some operations to proceed. You can allowlist specific domains. Same applies to being able to connect to TCP. 

**Dan Gohman:** These options would be global to a runtime?

**Dave Bakker:** Up to implementation.

**Dan Gohman:** It would be interesting to map to handle in the same way that we do pre-open

**Dave Bakker:** These rules are connected to a handle.

One extra option, which I haven’t researched, is to specify domain name and that is same as allowing all connections resolved from that domain name. Similar for inbound, TCP listeners are allowed with capabilities

**Chris Suszynski:** Just openned a ticket about exactly this. Mapping all these options could be simplified. Would like to see it follow the Docker or K8 standard. If you allow to connect to something with outbound, then you should be able to resolve that name. We could merge unbound with resolve. It should be done in a way where Wasm module always sees same logical name. 

**Till Schneidereit:** I think it might make sense to not dive too much into these things right now because the way I would think about this is as an overview of a proposal. The decision here is broad strokes whether it makes sense to pursue.

**Dave Bakker:** Overview, introduce one tiny module which is just sockets in this case. Depending on what this function returns, in foreseeable future there’s only two kinds of sockets. Sockets can be bound, etc. 

Are there any questions?

**Chris Suszynski:** Did you take a look at the standard libc functions? Will existing code magically work?

**Dave Bakker:** That is the goal. The regular socket API takes a domain socket type. Inside the impl of the wrapper API, you do a switch on the type of socket. There are a couple of examples in the repo.

Address lookup—the proposed function is significantly simpler than getaddrinfo. I chose a different name because of that. Why not getaddrinfo? Because getaddrinfo is very generalized, this proposal is not.

**Dan Gohman:** How does network interface name ___ fit into this proposal

**Dave Bakker:** using link local, so they can be abused to enum all network interfaces

**Chris Suszynski:** You said that the goal is for code written now should work, but if I use getaddrinfo. You need to call this new function.

**Dave Bakker:** Yes, you need a libc that handles all these listed cases. But those should all be implmentable in libc itself. From outside, there’s just a conforming getaddrinfo, and just the domain name lookups get through to WASI.

Something to be decided, what is the inverse of resolve_addresses.

Next steps: my suggestion is to split into 4 modules: socket, socket_tcp, socket_udp, ip_resolve_address

**Dan Gohman:** I have a question about the name. WASI already has networking proposals in flight. Can we call this WASI-sockets?

**Dave Bakker:** Yes, the plan is for each module to proceed.

**Chris Suszynski:** Awesome proposal, I really like it.

SA: Same, nice job.

**Chris Suszynski:** Do you have any time map or roadmap of how you’d like to proceed?

**Dave Bakker:** Are you asking for an ETA? No I dont’ have and ETA
