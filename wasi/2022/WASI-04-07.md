### wasi-url proposal

**George Kulakowski:** Going to put up the design more next time. Just introducing this time. Wanted to talk about why URLs at all. First reason, ubiquitous. So many APIs that people will want to express will require. They are already standardized so a lot of design work we don’t need to do. And an opportunity to do better than “just” strings. In an interface, easy to default to just strings.

With types, design decision is port u32 or string, or some stricter invariants. Do you get a string from IPv4 or more structured data type. How fine grained do we break things down. To force invariants is one thing.

Bounds are creating and manipulating URLs and accessing components, like query fragment. This is following WHATWG working spec for URLs. 

Given that, there are some concerns that the WHATWG doc addresses that WASI doesn’t need to, like rendering concerns. E.g. a browser rendering a URL as a string in a URL bar. Those aren’t in scope. Also includes reasoning about bidirectional characters in URL fragments. Secondarlity, many URL schemes that have their own constraints. Telephone, etc. 

**Syrus Akbary:** Trying to use URLs everywhere?

**George Kulakowski:** Goal is to have an API that can be used by other APIs. Not advocating for any particular use of URL

**Dave Bakker:** Proposal to add to component model interface types?

**Luke Wagner:** It wouldn’t become a primitive. Would provide an API using other interface types 

**George Kulakowski:** Goal is to define this using existing technologies

**Bailey Hayes:** Would it be part of wasi-common or its own component?

**Dan Gohman:** wasi-common in particular is part of wasmtime’s implementation. We don’t have a distinction between different WASI APIs

**Syrus Akbary:** How does this differ from W3C

**George Kulakowski:** Yes, that’s another document, WHATWG has a similar one which I mentioned. There’s not much design room. We may want to use stronger types.

**Dave Bakker:** How do you expect this to be used. Many languages have their own URL parsing and logic and libraries. How do they play together? Is this a replacement for them.

**George Kulakowski:** Good question in general. I expect it might vary a little bit across languages. I expect different bindings to define the point at which your standard URL type is able to be converted into this at the appropriate place.

**Piotr Sikora:** Would it expose ABI to parse URLs (e,g. Host, port etc)?

**George Kulakowski:** yes

**Dave Bakker:** Is it in scope for WASI?

**Dan Gohman:** There is no fundamental constraint that we have to follow here. First thing we’re talking about that’s outside of POSIX scope. I think it’s useful to have so that others can build on.

**Syrus Akbary:** Can you follow up where you think URL would be use

**Dan Gohman:** lots of places

**Luke Wagner:** wasi-http

**Syrus Akbary:** does wasi have an http interface?

**Lin Clark:** Yes, it’s in proposals list

**George Kulakowski:** There are several other proposals in phase 1 or 2 that mention internet standards. You could imagine a DNS api, and it would be good to use URL for something like that. I’d hope to see other proposals use this.

**Dan Gohman:** One of the great strengths of WASI is virtualization. That’s served by having a higher level API. We want hosts to have knowledge that they can make use of. 

**Dave Bakker:** How will the URL be represented in interface types. Will they be resources?

**Lin Clark:** Might be better to tackle after George has put up design doc

**George Kulakowski:** You have put your finger on a good issue. Suspect that the thing I’ll write up in the next few days will suggest not a resource, but looking forward to figuring this out. 

**Lin Clark:** FYI, those details aren't a blocker for Phase 1

**George Kulakowski:** Thanks, good to know
