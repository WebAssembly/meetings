### WASI Preview 2

**Dan Gohman**: Take a look at where WASI is today. Anticipating where IT and CM were going. IT has changed a lot. Things that were going into WASI are now going into CM. WASI focuses more on API level.

CM model has become focus for a lot of the things that are important to us. E.g. cross lang interop, robust composition, IDL.

With that background, introducing preview two built on top of that foundation. Snapshot 1 is in a ot of upstream toolchains. Idea for preview 2 is to be a new island of stability. Big tent pole feature is to build on top of wit.

Wit based tooling is aligned with the CM, but doesn’t require engine to implement the CM. Has a core wasm abi. Also gives us easy to use bindings. This allows us to get away from POSIX system call limitation. With wit based interfaces, we can have high-level enough types that we can expect devs to use the APIs directly. Less need for virtual filesystem APIs because the IDL based approach makes it easier to define without going into libc. Less pressure on generically designed APIs.

IDL thinking is a pretty big shift. Not a single ABI. Lots of different possible ABIs that map to the IDL.

Preview 2 allows us to bring in things like wasi-sockets more easily. Also work toward a milestone while allowing more development in the future. 

Other improvements: remove the rights system, more convenient preopen system. Make more of the APIs capability based. Revamp how readdir works and lots of other quality of life improvements. 

Dev plan: let’s define a milestone. Keep the feature set scoped rather than full CM. No async support, can’t link multiple components yet, no support for DLLs. This is consistent with preview 1. Also going to use GitHub project trackers (WASI Preview 2 (github.com) , WASI Preview2 Tracking (github.com)). One for standards work in WebAssembly org, and a corresponding one in the BA org for the implementation work that the BA is doing to prototype and implement.

**Dan Gohman**: questions

**Nathaniel McCallum**: Questions about sockets. Where/when to raise?

**Lin Clark:** Raise on the issue tracker, and then we can address in this meeting if anything can’t be resolved there.

**Syrus Akbary:** Wanted to remove the rights system, can you explain that?

**Dan Gohman**: Something that came from CloudABI. It’s very flexible but not in the ways that people need it to be.

**Syrus Akbary:** POSIX compat?

**Dan Gohman**: Complex question. Wasm will likely never have support for things like fork. Full POSIX compat isnt’ a meaningful goal for WASI because platform.

**Piotr Sikora:** Question about semantic versioning and split up in different modules.

**Dan Gohman**: There are some things useful to put into standard libraries. That kind of set makes sense to bring into preview 2. The milestone will have 2 meanings. This block of APIs, filesystems, etc that libc would need. Preview 2 also stands for a transition to WIT based tooling in general. The reduced dependence on libc will be involved here. When you can talk directly to WASI streams, you don't’ need to think about libc and using the filesystem to do that. 

**Nathaniel McCallum**: as we’ve been impl WASI in Tokio, undefined behavior. Would like to prioritize.

**Lin Clark:** Let’s handle that in separate meeting.

**Bailey Hayes:** With preview 1, able to add new features. Would we fold new features in preview 2.

**Dan Gohman**: My experience with preview 1 was that we weren’t able to iterate quickly.

**Bailey Hayes:** For async?

**Dan Gohman**: Preview 2 isn’t the end of the road. We don't’ see this as the final step, which is why we are calling it preview.

**Syrus Akbary:** There are some langs that are going to need support for exceptions. Do you see support of that it WIT.

**Dan Gohman**: WIT is a cross lang abstraction layer. Exceptions are lang dependent. Across interface boundaries, we’ll have a way to express errors, but we won’t have unwinding

**Luke Wagner:** Expected type has a failure case. Thats how we keep exception handling as a impl detail of the component.

**Syrus Akbary:** JS?

**Luke Wagner:** Yes

**Dan Gohman**: WASI Preview 2 commands

**Ben Titzer:** What about pausing for debugging?

**Dan Gohman**: Don’t think debugging needs to be defined in semantics of lang

Now that we’ve defined what a command is, how do we get to core Wasm ABI. Canonical ABI defines a mapping from a component into core wasm type. Engines can actually impl Canon ABI directly.

Another things CM gives us is concept of profile. A profile can define the shape of the component. Describes what imports and exports can be. 

Can model this as a command profile file. Let’s pull in env, logger, preopen, etc. All commands can use APIs that are in this list. All engines that provide this profile can run components that use this profile. WASI SG can define this profile. We can ask whether things like crypto belong in the command profile. We’ll have different platforms.

**Syrus Akbary:** Conflicts between transitive dependencies?

**Dan Gohman**: There is no global namespace, we can have multiple copies of env

**Luke Wagner:** And in general the type sharing is a key part of the design of the CM. This allows us to very precisely define.

**Dan Gohman**: Let’s look at cmd line args. We’ve been talking about plan for Typed Main. Status quo: strings require ambient perms, implicit agreements, etc. We want to move to a world where main takes streams and handles instead of strings. These handles carry perms with them. Plan for how this is going to fit in.

Env variables are the next thing in pantheon of Unix. Env can just be *: String. Programs will have to declare up front what env vars they actually want to use. This will make it a lot easier for developers to understand what env vars they need to declare.

Next is preopens. Designed a new system that doesn’t have out-of-band declaration. Propose that we automatically infer preopens. We’ll then bind with a UUID so that the program doesn’t see names.

**Nathaniel McCallum**: Strongly opposed to this for security.

**Dan Gohman**: This is erring on the side of usability.

**Nathaniel McCallum**: Goes against the general thrust.

**Luke Wagner:** Isn’t this a bit of the opposite? Before it would pass the filepath. It’s actually obscuring it with the UUID. 

**Dan Gohman**: This is a great discussion to have. In the context of this meeting, we should defer.

**Syrus Akbary:** One question was Deno in this case does something interesting. Allow or deny?

**Dan Gohman**: Not always the most convenient thing. There’s a usability tradeoff. Commands also won’t be the only story for WASI. 

**Nathaniel McCallum**: In our use case, interactive perms won’t work.

**Kyle Brown:** My question, what about false positive? E.g. a git branch that’s now being misconstrued.

**Dan Gohman**: We can actually check does this path actually exist. If it’s not there.

**Nathaniel McCallum**: Precisely race condition that has caused problems.

**Lin Clark:** Let’s take this discussion to a different context

**Nathaniel McCallum**: I agree

**Dan Gohman**: Preopens example

Final piece—Exit status of main. 

Stream i/o libc will present a sync API but the async API will be in place.
