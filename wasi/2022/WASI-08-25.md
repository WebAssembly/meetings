### presentation

- Jiaxiao Zhou
  - new cloud system with webassembly
  - engineering distributed apps is hard
    - best practices like 12-factor apps exist, but still too much toil and distraction from the core business logic
    - platform specific
    - problems like scalability
  - our solution: SpiderLightning
    - experiment with capabilities that extend WASI
    - vendor agnostic WIT interfaces for distributed applications
    - `slight` is an experimental CLI host implementing those capabilities
    - loads a configuration and provides resources corresponding to those capabilities
    - other host implementations could be built on the SpiderLightning interfaces
- Dan Chiarlone
  - DEMO!!
    - rust app using wit-bindgen generated interfaces from the SpiderLightning wit files
    - therefore backend implementation agnostic
  - big list of capabilities SpiderLighting and slight can bind to
- Jiaxiao
  - alternatives
    - Dapr is a distributed application runtime
      - provides services like service discovery, secret management, …
      - IPC to the sidecar container runtime providing the service, which also abstracts out the provider
      - by comparison, slight provides capabilities in-app
  - what’s next
    - SpiderLightning is very aligned, is it possible for it to become part of the WASI spec? especially with preview2 and stream I/O imminent
    - improving wit-based tooling like wit-bindgen
      - for example, supporting languages other than rust and C

### discussion and questions

- Ralph Squillace
  - this feels at a slightly different level than other discussions, which have been very constrained and highly typed
  - this approach tries to go a different way, with more abstract and high-level, application level interfaces rather than low level interfaces
- Dan Gohman
  - trying to understand this via the event mechanism. is it correct that those event payloads don’t have a type associated?
- Ralph Squillace
  - that’s an example
  - see the lower levels trying to be more precise about typing, eg getting away from stringly typed payloads
  - wanting to see if there’s a benefit to having less precise types to be able to abstract as we get closer to app-level capabilities
- Dan Gohman
  - I see this having some middleground capabilities compared to something like WASI filesystem, which also has a place within WASI. but it’s not going to be the center of everything.
  - see a good role for SpiderMonkey and think this makes a lot of sense
  - excited to talk about individual APIs
- Mossaka
  - is the next step making a proposal? where?
- Dan Gohman
  - I definitely think this makes sense to do within the WASI umbrella. there’s a template
- Lin Clark
  - can poll to advance without the template, which could happen next week
- Andrew Brown
  - what about optional parts of the WASI interface?
  - suppose some application doesn’t want to provide a part of the SpiderMonkey interface
  - WASI is still in the process of figuring out how to describe that
- Dan Gohman
  - profiles will be part of the answer to this. they’ll be part of the platform we build on
  - component model answering a lot of these questions but not yet fleshed out
  - I again want to draw the parallel to WASI filesystem, which also isn’t something that’s appropriate to provide in a lot of environments that people here are working in. so this isn’t a new problem
- Andrew Brown
  - so if a user wrote code that uses e.g. wasi filesystem file open in such an environment. where does it fail?
- Dan Gohman
  - instantiation time
  - more nuance in the future, like with weak imports
- Andrew Brown
  - is there a need to describe whether APIs will be optional?
- Dan Gohman
  - I think we will need that
  - instantiation time will continue to be the ultimate place where decisions about availability are made
