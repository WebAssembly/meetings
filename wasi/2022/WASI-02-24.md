### Poll: Advance wasi-sockets to Phase 1
**Till Schneidereit:** One question, what are your plans for how to proceed on working on it given that there’s a whole bunch of separate proposals. 

**Lin Clark:** Poll today is just about wasi-sockets

**Chris Suszynski:** Is this proposal including DNS?

**Dan Gohman:** The dns proposal here is a synchronous API designed to line up with the libc

**Dave Bakker:** not direct mapping to libc

**Dan Gohman:** My sense is that this api makes sense accompanying sockets. Doesn’t need to be the only DNS api. DNS has lots of options, dont’ need them for every use case

**Dave Bakker:** The address resolve API is indeed just the basics so it usually only goes to the localhost file or A records, so it’s not really a DNS api. DNS is a separate module

**Chris Suszynski:** Complicated because there are NS switch, so you can have various backends to the file. So there’s a couple of APIs in the system. So I was thinking about it and I think even stripping out the DNS would make it simpler. You could of course connect to DNS by IP and port and resolve what you want to do from there. Even if we just provide the sockets, it’s also satisfactory for most of the applications because the routing should be done by the host. We could provide DNS support in the future.

**Dave Bakker:** Current proposal doesn’t include DNS in scope, can be backed by DNS optionally.

**Lin Clark:** Need to be answered before poll?

**Vibhav Pant:** Let’s say if we do have DNS component in the API and there are other services that resolve, we aren’t mandating that they resolve through that particular component, right? I’m thinking about how Go would provide a network API. So those implementations are free to use anything else to resolve names?

**Dave Bakker:** Yes. There are multiple paths forward. You can imagine a wasi module for DNS resolution itself, or you could just use the sockets API to create your own DNS server.

**Vibhav Pant:** So if an engine were to find ways to limit what domains or networks they could call into, then just 

**Dave Bakker:** Just having access to sockets doesn’t mean you can access the whole world. Even when you have access to sockets, the engine must somehow provide you access to specific endpoints. 

**Vibhav Pant:** So it’s up to the engine to ensure that everything passes through the same point.

**Dave Bakker:** correct

**Lin Clark:** Any other questions? Ok, ready to poll. Will do a consensus poll. Anyone object to wasi-sockets moving to phase 1?

No objections, wasi-sockets moves to phase 1
