### Poll: gRPC

**Lin Clark:** Piotr, Dan and Joe will collaborate as champions on HTTP and gRPC
**Kevin Hoffman:** Concern that gRPC is conceptually a different thing
**Jiaxiao Zhou:** also has code generator
**Kevin Hoffman:** also has bi-directional stuff
**Piotr Sikora:** HTTP also has bidirectional stuff
**Kevin Hoffman:** Not saying HTTP doesn’t support. But the basic HTTP interface doesn’t utilize that. When you describe a HTTP server, lot more description of what’s going one way, one going another
**Lin Clark:** Sounds to me that we could decide later
**Piotr Sikora:** Technically could consider gRPC as a layer above WASI
**Luke Wagner:** Given a gRPC request, would you want access to headers, etc.
**Piotr Sikora:** I dont’ think so
**Luke Wagner:** If you don’t want underlying HTTP stuff, then it makes sense to have gRPC separate
**Kevin Hoffman:** I could be misremembering, but IIRC it’s supposed to be transport agnostic. 
**Piotr Sikora:** I don’t think that’s true
**Kevin Hoffman:** That’s why I asked to refresh my memory, wasn’t sure
**Piotr Sikora:** I think gRPC is defined on top of HTTP headers and status codes
**Jiaxiao Zhou:** Side note: I believe HTTP and gRPC are quite different from previous proposals we discussed. They are protocol specific. Should we just have layer 7
**Lin Clark:** My sense is we do want protocol specific.
**Lin Clark:** Any concerns about gRPC moving forward?
**Lin Clark:** Congrats on the new proposal!


### Introducing Worlds for WIT

**Brian Hardock:** Nothing final, everything in flux. Bringing up here because it’s really exciting development in wit and tooling space

What does wit currently define? Single interface IDL. No way to capture directionality of the API. Taking motivation of http handler. Common practice to split out common types. Today, 4 ways to consume HTTP handler interface. Dot product of guest/host and export/import. Grappling with different perspectives is a challenge. For this example, might imagine condensing some of these. But for each interface that might be required to be implemented, might have any number of itnerfaces. Having to chain multiple invocations is hard. This will make codegen for our component much more complicated. In general a single component will refer to 0-N interfaces. 

World is designed to address this complexity. It expresses it in the IDL. A World is just a collection of imports and exports. They express the contract between guest and host components. Allows us to actually articulate and collect something that you can feed into a code generator. Can say generate bindings for a particular world. Interesting consequence of operating over worlds is we can ask whether a guest’s requirements can be satisfied by a particular host. 

The real benefit is that as developer, we only have two perspectives to think about. Some more motivations: all hit issues with trying to share types across interfaces. In terms of shared tooling, we want to give a world to wit-bindgen and have host and guest bindings generated for a particular language. 

Type sharing and linked bindings is the problem we’ve all come across. Alex did the diligence of collapsing into issue 266 in wit-bindgen. 

Realized we can perform a global resolution to check for equivalency across interfaces. Particularly focused on global resolver for shared bindings. 

Ongoing discussions that are happening: how do we actually structure wit files. Can we write one wit file. How do we reference types in other namespaces. Consensus developing around supporting single wit and also support split out into multiple files for reuse and distribution.

How do we treat wit with all interfaces is open question.

Example of HTTP proxy.

**Dave Bakker:** What’s the difference between a component interface and a world. 

**Brian Hardock:** The world is effectively a component type. The interface maps to instance type. More generically, a world is a family of components. A world is a function that takes imports and as a result returns exports. Type at time of instantion is fixed. A world is meant to reflect that it’s a higher order over any number of interfaces which could result an instances. I’ve been trying to shift away from thinking of a world as a component. 

**Steve S:** Question about futures. Is an interface tightly bound to whether it’s async or not? Is that something that can be abstracted? Could the world bind it to being async or not?

**Luke Wagner:** Whether a func is async or not just shows up as the return. It returns a future result of response. Not a whole world, binary decision. Goal of async types is that they should compose.

**Andrew Brown:** Higher level question about registry. If someone wants to publish to a registry, would require a world?

**Luke Wagner:** Ideally a component is entirely self describing. Should be able to ask the most tightly fitting world for a component. Lots of worlds. Standard ones, host-specific ones, which world they target doesn’t matter because the interfaces line up with where I want to publish them. What world I used isn’t encoded in the component. It’s just interfaces used.

**Andrew Brown:** To follow on to that, all importa dn exports will have URLs. All proposals will have URLs. What about custom interfaces. 

**Luke Wagner:** URL is an optional part of the name. If you have your own bespoke, then you would leave off the URL.

**Chris Suszynski:** Doubt—always the biggest problem is naming. I worry about really similar Worlds. Some kind of union of worlds would be useful?

**Brian Hardock:** Yes, in the PR we’ve discussed the concept of extends, which allows for composition.

**Chris Suszynski:** I’m thinking about wanting to target two worlds. Something like and keyword would be useful.

**Luke Wagner:** Big motivating design challenge was trying to support union and intersection of worlds. So part of that is that the particular world I use doesn’t matter. World is just a convenience thing.
