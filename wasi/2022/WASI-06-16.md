### Propose including WIT as a part of the WASI subgroup

- **Bailey Hayes**
  - Singlestore (my employer) has shipped wasm to production!
  - thinking a lot about backwards compatibility because of that
  - as part of that thought process, we are considering the idea of the WIT IDL as part of the WASI subgroup
- **Lin Clark**
  - another potential home that I see is the component model
  - I definitely agree that it should be standardized, and I think that is uncontroversial
- **Bailey Hayes**
  - maybe thoughts about what we want to add could help inform that
  - we interface to databases a lot
  - one thing people want to do is express a lot of mathematical functions
  - want to have something like simd-backed wit interfaces to meet that use case
  - in a lot of ways that is not a systems-level interface but instead building blocks you need to build those interfaces
  - so in that sense, not about WASI-as-system interface, but it does feel like this is the right group to raise it with
- **Luke Wagner**
  - absolutely makes sense to standardize it
  - I’ve waffled on where to do so
  - component model feels like lower level syntax targeted by higher-level tools
  - that makes me think it should be a layer higher, where things that compile down to component model live
  - and maybe WASI is the layer higher
- **Francis McCabe**
  - I think the question of where it should go depends on how independent WIT is from everything else, and whether it is the original source of truth about a given interface or whether that is another IDL
- **Bailey Hayes**
  - I think that’s dependent on the component model
  - derived from a component - you could generate wit from a component
- **Luke Wagner**
  - true, but I could also go the other direction
  - so it may not be the case that there’s a single answer to the question of what the original source of truth is
- **Josh Triplett**
  - I wanted to second that I also desire to use interface types in production in the next 12 month timeframe, so I also want more stability and therefore standardization
  - to Luke’s point, I can understand both wanting the layering and the abstraction, and also the value of having the One True IDL
  - it would be nice if, from my rust perspective, we could point to only one IDL that covers all layers of functionality
- **Petr Penzin**
  - wit doesn’t support everything
  - if you are targeting cloud and everything is already (de)serialized
  - but certain things like funcrefs aren’t supported in WIT (yet)
  - so for certain use cases WIT doesn’t support it
- **Josh Triplett**
  - I am very much hoping that is a “yet” and that that will be supported in the future
- **Luke Wagner**
  - a very big point to solve in the design space is closures across boundaries, so we have cycles
  - browsers cycle collect but control lots of code on either side of the boundary
  - we have different parts of the answer
  - async is one part, by providing another solution rather than passing callback closures around
  - but the case of passing funcrefs and pointers, the shared memory multithreading scenario
  - one way we’ve thought about that, that isn’t in WIT yet, is to describe in WIT the imports of a module, and instantiate that module with my own memory, and have control over the memory sharing
  - I do hope that this feels like the very advanced case and is often not needed
- **Petr Penzin**
  - I don’t think we have to get too deep into this since it’s not directly the topic
  - I want to highlight that WASM pointers are technically different from C pointers
- **Francis McCabe**
  - I’m not sure I see what function pointers have to do with where WIT is standardized
  - when we were working on interface types, we did have a strategy
  - long story short, we found it better to not have them at all at this point in time
  - this discussion does expose some confusion about where WIT should live
  - I personally think it is better as part of the component model due to all the entanglement with component model design choices
- **Lin Clark**
  - not sure we will get to resolution in this meeting
  - consider: we could reflect on this and re-raise the topic in a future meeting
  - let’s do it

### Component Model async proposal (part 2)

**Luke Wagner** presenting

- optimization: streams
  - an optimized version of something you could (almost!) express anyway
  - futures-that-maybe-return-more-futures not quite fast enough
  - bytestream could be optimized to be faster
    - bulk copies
    - directly copied
  - but want types too
  - also want to plug in to backpressure
  - and languages/ecosystems increasingly have similar abstractions, and want to keep those idioms
  - so: stream<T>
  - worked example of compilation of gzipping a stream, how it lowers to the canonical abi, and how it optimizes compared to the non-stream equivalent

- **Petr Penzin**
  - how’s it work in the browser case?
- **Luke Wagner**
  - bundling the runtime which exposes this “syscall” like interface
  - so in JS, this gets into the native JS api for streams
- **Petr Penzin**
  - reason I’m asking is about the callback-based JS async api
- **Luke Wagner**
  - but moving to promises
  
- optimization: splicing and skipping streams
  - canonical ABI operations to splice and forward and skip in bulk
  
- **Josh Triplett**
  - what about a stream of variably-sized objects. say, strings
- **Luke Wagner**
  - builds on what’s already in the canonical abi, which places things in separate allocations
- **Josh Triplett**
  - my question was about validity, so the pointers have to remain valid until you get the complete event

- state machine
  - outline of all the states and transitions a stream object can be in
  - leads us to want to generalize to Tasks
- a task is a stateful resource representing an asynchronous computation
  - producer state
    - like the stream state
  - consumer state
    - listening or not listening
  - write/return/listen
    - look at both states to enable things like eager return
- now we can start working towards structured concurrency
  - tasks form a task tree
  - using the supertask and subtask terminology
    - to avoid parent/child which language is already used by instance relationships
  - unique ownership because the graph is a tree
    - but subtasks can be transferred to new supertasks
  - host-implemented tasks
    - a single root
    - can have host leaf tasks
- canonical abi repr of tasks
  - task table
  - subtask table
    - track edges
  - both tables instance-wide
- structured concurrency
  - task tree is effectively the “async version” of a sync callstack
  - add invariants
    - subtasks can’t outlive their supertasks
      - … although they can be moved
      - get nice things like debugging/tracing help
  - how does a task finish?
    - canon finish
  - how is a subtask deallocated?
    - canon drop

- **Petr Penzin**
  - where is all of this implemented? who manages the per-task state machine?
- **Luke Wagner**
  - the runtime
- **Petr Penzin**
  - does this become part of core wasm?
- **Luke Wagner**
  - one viewpoint, the core module imports the canonical abi, that’s it
  - more interesting thinking about linking multiple modules
  - trampolines between modules
  - those trampolines can manage the task records
