## Typed Main (Kyle Brown)

- Kyle Brown
  - now named the CLI embedding proposal
  - goal is to infer as much as possible about how to infer as much as possible about CLI programs from their type, minimizing the amount of information that needs to be carried around in special sections
  - all value imports can be supplied as positional or named arguments
    - this choice of positional or named isn’t part of the type
  - value imports that are of file type automatically become preopened files
  - arguments can be optional
  - flags are exactly the arguments of boolean type
  - short flags have to be explicitly configured since names can collide on single letter flag names
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - like it overall
  - the one area that feels magical overall is how arguments are all automatically both positional and named
  - feels unintuitive relative to existing expectations
- Kyle Brown
  - decided that this was the more convenient default overall
  - there is an annotation to override it
  - the motivation is to let this work with components off-the-shelf not written with CLIs in mind
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - concerned about subverting expectations of CLIs in unintuitive ways
- Kyle Brown
  - can explore
  - welcome more feedback on the PR
- Petr Penzin
  - curious about how exactly this relates to existing libraries for parsing arguments
- Kyle Brown
  - note that the special preopen handling of files points to why its important for the host to be involved
- Petr Penzin
  - how would I write code to use this in a source language? or maybe you don’t have to?
- Kyle Brown
  - write down the type (via wit-bindgen or some other tool). everything else stems from that type, for guests. hosts have to do the work to implement this
- Dave Bakker
  - curious about subcommands like npm and git have
- Kyle Brown	
  - not (yet) addressed by this proposal
  - have thought about it, can imagine a discriminated union main type corresponding to subcommands

## WASI Crypto (Frank Denis)

- Frank Denis
  - a set of APIs to do cryptography from wasm
    - signatures
    - key exchange
    - encryption
    - hashing
    - key derivation
  - exposed from the host rather than in core wasm code
  - why?
    - speed
    - correctness
    - side channel hardening
    - compliance
    - reusability
    - access to hardware acceleration
  - not opinionated about APIs
    - expose things that are widely used, even if they are deprecated or better alternatives exist
  - keys
    - keys are exposed as handles by default
  - safety
    - strongly typed
      - as strongly typed handles
      - eg keys know their algorithms and parameters
    - nonces can be automatically generated only when safe to do so
    - only allow safe and commonly used parameters
  - not a crypto library
    - this is more like a set of system calls
  - stability as a constraint
    - simple, safe, easy to use from various languages
    - can’t churn
  - not directly intended for use by applications
  - allow languages newly targeting wasm to have immediate access to crypto
  - current implementations
    - runtimes: wasmedge, wasmtime
    - adapters: assemblyscript and rust
    - standard libraries: zig
    - applications: jwt-simple
  - in the next wasi snapshot?
    - need to finalize the first version of this spec
    - test suite
    - make sure that future features (e.g. streams) won’t introduce backwards compatible changes
  - does this need a dedicated wg meeting?
- jlbirch
  - how do you configure or provide a provider? eg the choice of openssl
  - second, performance: do you have benchmarks etc showing that having native code exposed via the host is much faster than doing it in wasm?
- Frank Denis
  - we may add the option later to configure the provider
  - but the goal is to abstract away any difference between providers, so there should be no change to guest code. in particular, want to automatically provide the fastest implementation for the given host
  - wanted to prevent applications from handcoding keys
  - can’t guarantee side channel freedom is wasm right now
  - can’t access e.g. aesni instructions from wasm directly right now
- Filippo Valsorda
  - I’m a maintainer of go stdlib cryptography. this direction is excellent for us
  - I understand the goal of wanting simple APIs, but don’t know how to build things using e.g. opaque identifiers
- Frank Denis
  - applications should not have to change anything to advantage of wasi crypto
  - but not for other things which may use their existing library code
  - again: wasi crypto is not a crypto library, it is a set of “syscalls” for libraries to be built on top of, and applications can use that
  - around opaque identifiers, say for keys. the runtime can block the operation of exporting the contents of key material. this is a policy of the host -implementing wasi-crypto
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - practical experience from being on redhat’s crypto team
  - this experience of making key material inaccessible and handle-based is well trodden ground by now
  - excited to contribute and I’d be very interested in a Working Group
- Frank Denis
  - will discuss on the github repo about meetings etc
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - maybe we can break the proposal up into smaller parts to have more digestible parts of the entire interface
  - one other piece of feedback, some APIs currently operate on global state
