### Conversational venues for WASI discussion (George Kulakowski)

 * https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/pull/1019

**George Kulakowski:** Are there venues other than this meeting where discussions are happening?

**Bailey Hayes:** A lot of WASI discussions occur on the bytecodealliance zulip.

**Dan Gohman:** The WASI-url repo is a good place for posting design docs.

### Native threads WASI API (Alexandru Ene)

 * https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/pull/1024

**Alexandru Ene:** (presentation)

**Andrew Brown:** We should have a separate meeting to dive more deeply into the details about instance-per-thread or multiple instances.

**Nathaniel McCallum:** We (Profian) would very much like to see native threads. Many frameworks assume that threads exist on the platform.

**Sam Clegg:** We should be careful not to duplicate spec work in core wasm.

**Dan Gohman:** This is where the instance-per-thread idea comes in. Browsers already have instance-per-thread, so one option is for WASI to just have an API for creating a thread which works in a similar way. That would reuse all the existing specs.

**Luke Wagner:** What’s in browsers right now is not something that anyone is happy with. It was an MVP to get something working. JS is single-threaded; we have to be careful not to let multithreaded wasm call into single-threaded JS. “Weakening WebAssembly” is a paper which describes a design for adding a fork instruction. It would require adding shared annotations to everything in modules, including functions, globals, etc. to make sure that everything that can be affected by threads is prepared for it.

Lots of limitations with instance-per-thread: lots of duplicated state, dlopen doesn’t work. So what we really want is the fork instruction of “Weakening WebAssembly”.

**Alexandru Ene:** Can we make multiple-threads-per-instance an optimization, over instance-per-thread?

**Petr Penzin:** What are the semantics of shared?

**Luke Wagner:** The paper has a proposed semantics.

**Luke Wagner:** For example, if you import a JS func, it would need to be non-shared.

**Nathaniel McCallum:** Is instance-per-thread observable?

**Sam Clegg:** In instance-per-thread, wasm globals are thread-local. If we have multiple threads per instance, they’d share a global.

**Luke Wagner:** It’s possible to have an API which makes a separate instance, which could work in the short term. But it seems unlikely to be something that could be standardized.

**Alexandru Ene:** Why did it get standardized in the browser?

**Luke Wagner:** In the browser, Web Workers already existed.

**Luke Wagner:** I’d propose someone add core-wasm support for the proposed fork instruction.

**Alexandru Ene:** I’ll take a look at that.

**Andrew Brown:** Before we dive too deeply into this, let’s give people a chance to study the paper.

**Andrew Brown:** It doesn’t seem like browsers are motivated to implement this right now.

**Luke Wagner:** I believe no one’s against this, it’s just not a high enough priority.

**Alexandru Ene:** Could people interested in having a meeting file issues: github.com/AlexEne/wasi-native-threads/

**Andrew Brown:** Sam Clegg, would native threads help Emscripten?

**Sam Clegg:** Yes, Emscripten has lots of magic hacks for threads currently, especially around keeping the tables in sync, and native threads would improve it.

**Nathaniel McCallum:** If we do instance-per-thread, it’s a half measure, which adds a cost: we have to support these pseudo-processes forever.

**Sam Clegg:** It may be fine to do a two-prong solution, with a stop-gap instance-per-thread for now, and doing the real thing at the wasm level.

**Nathaniel McCallum:** Would it make sense to have multiple memories?

**Amanieu d’Antras:** Would it be possible to have an instance-per-thread which would be forward-compatible to threads-per-instance model?

**Sam Clegg:** It depends on wasm standards decisions.

**Petr Penzin:** It seems like we should be able to make this compatible.

**Luke Wagner:** It might be a good idea to require the API to be pollyfillable on the Web.

**Alexandru Ene:** Please comment in https://github.com/AlexEne/wasi-native-threads/issues/1 to register interest in meeting to discuss this further.
