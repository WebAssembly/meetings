### Let's Talk About: wasi-pubsub, and wasi-message-queue by Danilo (Dan) Chiarlone

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kg5boq7L36B2Z_zM-v1tU-JB1aNb09DcZ-2JNJbFtSg/edit?usp=sharing

PR for wasi-pubsub: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-pubsub/pull/2

Dan: Presentation

Dan: Proposal: Should we merge wasi-pubsub and wasi-messagequeue into wasi-messaging?

https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-pubsub/pull/2

Mossaka: Would it make sense to call this “pubsub” instead of “messaging”?

From Joel Dice to Everyone 09:12 AM
presumably Dan is trying to get away from pubsub since it implies topics and shared ownership of messages
From Bailey Hayes to Everyone 09:12 AM
let's dig into the wit because I think the interface might lean us more one way over the other

From Chris Suszynski to Everyone 09:13 AM
PubSub directly link to Google Pub/Sub product

From Steve S to Everyone 09:13 AM
I don’t think of messaging as specific to actors. Messaging is used for rest & grpc, and other protocols for any components. Even applies to client-server and websockets.

Joel: Kafka streams can specify where to start. Should we have an interface for that?

Dan: We could add that, though it would be a separate interface because not all impls could support it. It’s considered an antipattern in some impls. Though Eventhub could also implement it.

David Justice: I don’t think offsets are an antipattern. Log processing uses it.

From Joel Dice to Everyone 09:18 AM
being able to specify and offset allows exactly once delivery, which is extremely useful
*and -> an
From David Justice to Everyone 09:19 AM
*exactly once* or *at least once*

Mossaka: This uses CloudEvents; do we want to support other message formats?

Steve: On Cloud events: They have an arbitrary payload and a field for a mime type, so this could encapsulate any kind of message format. It could wrap anything else. 

From Bailey Hayes to Everyone 09:24 AM
CloudEvents is widely adopted
From Bailey Hayes to Everyone 09:25 AM
for projects that work within CNCF, it would be surprising to NOT see CloudEvents

From Bailey Hayes to Everyone 09:25 AM
* https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs/cloudevents

Mossaka: Also, the channel here has a queue and a topic, which are both identified as a string. Do we want to support queue patterns where you can specify eg. a regex that identifies a group of topic names?

Steve: There’s a lot of value in having a simple interface. If the server has the flexibility to interpret the strings, this API would work.

Steve: Stream receive and on-receive should also have a timeout.

From David Justice to Everyone 09:24 AM
The “inbox” RPC mechanism is often used in AMQP (Az Service Bus, etc)
From David Justice to Everyone 09:25 AM
In AzSB, the first message is sent with a “reply-to” annotation (I think)

Dan: Function for an acknowledgement: We could add an acknowledgement for stream-receive.

Chris: Is it worthwhile to walk through some example use cases?

Dan: The interface proposed here is very similar to spiderlightning repo. It’s implemented with Kafka and Mosquito, and we also implement messagequeue for ServiceBus and a filesystem implementation. But I’d be open to walking through other use cases. I could put something together for the next WASI meeting?

Chris: That’d be awesome.

From Dave Bakker  to Everyone 09:27 AM
No specific suggestion, but given the wide area of questions, the term "messaging" terminology&interface feels to too broad

Mossaka: When the publisher publishes a message, do they get an acknowledgement that the message was received by the receiver?

Dan: The receiver could commit the message.

Steve: Some kind of acknowledgement is needed for reliable delivery protocols.

Mossaka: I was imagining an on-acknowledgement hook.

Steve: Is the result from the public API not enough of an ack?

Mossaka: Ack from broker to publisher, so the publisher can publish a message asynchronously, and then the broker pushes an ack back.

Steve: Could this be done with a subscription?
*brainstorming in the design space*

From Bailey Hayes to Everyone 09:30 AM
Another source for inspiration and a good place we can add a reference implementation is https://github.com/wasmCloud/interfaces/blob/main/messaging/messaging.smithy

Luke: For a next presentation: It’d be helpful to see lists of concrete implementations and use cases, to see how this works out.



### Let's talk about: wasi-blob-store and range requests in wasi-keyvalue by Steve Schoettler. Sub-topics include "Resource handles for blobs", and "Designing wasi-cloud interfaces while considering variations in implementation"


Blob store:

Storing potentially large blobs of data. S3, OpenStack object store, etc.

https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-blob-store

Key value:

PR adding range requests: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue/pull/4

Mossaka: Transactions?

Steve: I think this would be hard to implement with a streaming response. It’d be easy to get deadlocks; if the consumer crashes, would the transaction be released? I’d recommend against putting this in a transaction.

I’d like to explore interfaces for transactions for multiple cloud APIs. And more broadly, there’s a question of consistency across WASI interfaces. Is there a way to do transactions that’s not specific to each interface?

Joel: In the range APIs, would it make sense to make the end parameters optional? “Give me everything later than Oct 21” for example. Minimum or maximum kinds of usage.

Steve: Good idea!

Bailey:

especially looking for feedback on:
```
get-data: func(name: object-name, start: u64, end: u64) -> result<data-blob, Error>
