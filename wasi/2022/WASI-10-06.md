### WASI Preview 2 status update - Dan Gohman


Dan Gohman
shortening the part to transitioning to wit
new milestone that comes before:
streams/futures
value imports
resource subtyping
additional canonical abi simplifications
no name mangling
post-return functions
implement the wasi_snapshot_preview1 api with preview2 apis
shorten the path to adoption
prototype at https://github.com/sunfishcode/preview1.wasm
polyfilling the other direction may also make sense
in general, polyfills as bridges to preview3 and beyond
wasi-sockets is going to be integrated as well
Steve S
you mentioned Command a few times, is there anything that doesn’t work equally well for a Reactor as well?
Dan Gohman
this milestone is a hello world sort of milestone
all of this is usable in a reactor context as well, though



### Worlds: modeling Environment Variables - Dan Gohman
- Dan Gohman
  - using `*`-imports
  - context: wasi:cli/Command
    - a world which imports filesystem, socket, etc and exports a main
  - new idea: use a preopen variant rather than subtyping
    - closed vs open set
  - link-time capabilities
    - need a handle to get a handle
    - how do you get initial handles?
    - via preopen is one way
    - another is what I’m calling link-time capabilities
    - example of getting default monotonic and wall clocks
    - extensible for other kinds of initial handles
  - so what about environment variables? not covered by the above mechanisms
  - considerations about envvars
    - portabilitity
      - case sensitivity, limits, naming conventions
    - sandboxing
      - more of a concern
      - dont want to expose paths, usernames, auth state…
    - composition
      - if two programs communicate, do they share an envvar namespace?
    - possible solutions
      - separate sandboxes
        - expensive
      - denylists
        - hard to be complete or universally applicable or up to date
      - end user control
        - tedious, so gets scripted around
      - manifest!
        - static sidecar description of what envvars they use
        - plausible because most getenv calls are passed string constants
    - so what if envvars were wit imports?
    - what types would components using these have?
    - `*`-imports
      - a World is a family of component types
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - like the idea of describing the environment as a file of some type
  - in secure embedded compute, we don’t trust the host, so having an external trusted description is compelling
- Kevin
  - wondering if the environment variables as imports go in a world file or a component wit file?
  - and if I have large composed hierarchy of components, how do I keep one component from being able to access envvars intended for another component
- Dan Gohman
  - proposing using imports to express this
  - imports are just functions, in this case returning strings
  - the names of the functions correspond to the envvars
  - the imports can be satisfied by exports with the same signature
  - so the person doing the composing decides how to wire up imports to exports
- Dan Gohman
  - `*` means any number which allows the host to say I have a namespace, I can accept a family of components
  - also useful for http backends, kv stores, etc
- Mossaka (Joe)
  - wondering what the rust programmer experience of this is like
  - ordinarily they can do something like just get an iterator over them all
  - now there’s a lot of separate functions
- Dan Gohman
  - imagining some way for the toolchain to wire these all together
  - in rust, maybe a macro generated via the wit-bindgen tooling
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - are you concerned about overloading on the types? especially importing an envvar and something else with a potentially colliding name
- Dan Gohman
  - the import mechanism in general has a two-level design that separates out things into namespaces
  - don’t need to do any type-based disambiguation
- Nathaniel McCallum
  - do you think this will be extensible to other kinds of resources?
  - an example that comes to mind is cryptographic keys
- Dan Gohman
  - subtle tradeoffs
  - comes down to, when do you want to close the set of names that are valid?
- `*`-imports does it at instantiation time
  - in wit files is much earlier bound
- Dan Gohman
  - another question from the chat is about versioning of urls
  - my understanding from the component model is that semver-incompatible changes will get new urls, which in practice might look like embedding a version in the url
