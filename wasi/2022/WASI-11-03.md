### Worlds in SpiderLightning interfaces (wasi-kv-store, wasi-pubsub, etc.) - Jiaxiao (Joe) Zhou
 
Mossaka: SpiderLightling is a set of capability interfaces designed to make distributed applications portable across hosting providers. There are many interfaces but today we will focus on `wasi-kv-store`. A kv store is like a hashmap/dictionary: it stores key-value pairs efficiently. Values have limited datatypes (often json) and are schemaless. <a discussion of consistency>. <a discussion of transactions>. 
Mossaka: now lets go into the interfaces. Here is an interface for non-transactional data stores, the operations are get, set, del, and exists. Here are the common type definitions for kv: Error is a resource, payload is a resource that can be consumed synchronously or asynchronously (list of u8 or stream of u8). Key is just a string, and keys are a stream of key. 
 
Joel Dice: your interface is using resources and async, do we need to wait on this proposal until those are in wit?
 
Mossaka: We can get rid of async for now, this is part of why I made payload a resource type so we can just implement the sync part for now. Set value would be a list of u8 instead of a stream of u8.
 
Mossaka: Many datastores do not fully support transactions but they do support single-object transactions, often called atomic. I have an interface called `kv/data/atomic` which has a single function `incr: func(key: key) -> result<u64, Error>` Often time to leave is a useful feature, so here is a `kv/data/ttl` with a func `set-with-ttl: func(key, value, ttl: u64) -> result<_, Error>`. So now we have four interfaces total that are the non-transactional interfaces.
 
Mossaka: for transactional interfaces, there are distinct read-transactional and write-transactional interfaces, because some databases are only read-transactional. <more in-depth description of slides>. There is a query interface as well, for scanning across the whole set of keys.
 
Bailey: It is not obvious that these interfaces are transactional - will users know this has transactional behavior or do users need a higher level interface? The transactional part of this interface is a lot trickier so maybe it is better off being separate.
 
Kevin: My concern is that there are many possible implementations of these transactional interfaces and they will have different amounts of transactionality. I don’t know what bulk is supposed to do without going to read documentation on the interface. The guarantee or lack of guarantee around transactions needs to be explicit in the interface.
 
Joel: Compare and set are valuable to define different atomics, you can build mutexes
 
Mossaka: Someone asked about etags in the chat. The payload resource could have additional operations to describe the version of the value.
 
Dan: Time check
 
Mossaka: Now lets talk about worlds. Here is a world that imports kv with crud operations, and exports an http handler. Then there is a world for cloud services, it imports kv and mq and etc, and exports an http handler.
 
Colin Murphy: Interfaces between kv stores, across the ecosystem, are very inconsistent. The kv interface for dynamodb is way different from the one wasmcloud exposes, so I actually switched to using the sql interface to dynamodb. This interface would work for <missed> and redis, and thats about it
 
Mossaka: <notetaker missed this answer>

Ralph: I think the Key-Value plus Transactions portion needs more thought before it's settled. And usage will tell us a lot there.
 
Kevin: A worlds part of the standard?

Dan: The world construct is being developed to be standardized in the component model.

Kevin: Is the set of Worlds to be fixed?

Dan: WASI will define some standard Worlds, but embedders can also define and use their own derived or even fully-custom worlds.

Colin: Interfaces feel like lenses/windows/views. If you hide dynamodb behind a key-value "lens", then you can only see/interact with the key-value shaped surface area. OrientDB is a great example of this, where you can interact with graph features in one mode or relational in another. Some databases will fit with wide utilization into a key-value interface (redis), whereas others might be shoehorned (dynamo).
 
### SQL Embedding - Kyle Brown
 
Kyle: There is another side of the SQL coin, how to use wasm in SQL rather than using SQL in wasm. Function-like embeddings: a user-defined function defined as a wasm component, you can use it when selecting things in a where predicate. User defined functions are scalar functions (no side effects). User defined aggregate functions accumulate inputs from many rows into one output. Table valued functions: function whose output is a table (example: calendar_for_year(). Type mapping: users are not always required to specify SQL types, so there needs to be a component value type to sql type mapping. This proposal has a table: for example i64 maps to sql bigint. We could also have a set of allowable mappings, for example float32 can map to either sql float or double, float64 can only map to sql double. Sql doesnt have a concept of result or error values, we don’t know how to map that exactly, you could treat an error as ending query execution but that is a little brittle. Sql provides types without a component equivalent, most basic being dates, also custom types. We could parse a string as a date using an iso standard, or take a record with the fields, we need some explicit type mapping.
 
Kyle: bundling sql functionality: users will want to contain one component with multiple UDF, UDAF, and TVFs, as a library of SQL functionality. We propose to use custom sections to describe how a function export maps to sql land, for example treat this function as a UDF with the following name in sql. UDAFs have multiple different functions in it, so we would annotate each of them with the same UDAF name to treat multiple exports as a single UDAF.

Mossaka: I wonder how `resource` type would map to SQL type?

Ralph: We're going to learn where this boundary lies.
