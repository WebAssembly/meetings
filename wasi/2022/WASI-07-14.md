No objections, poll succeeds!

### Component Model async proposal (part 3) (slides)

Presented by Luke Wagner, hopefully the last of these installments :)

- revisiting a `future` example
  - task originally owned by the stack
  - can pass the ownership explicitly
  - respecting the full structured concurrency model
  - the canonical abi special cases the outparam case to enable eager return
- general case where we don’t eagerly return
  - let’s return a `future<list<future<string>>>`
  - walking through creation of and transfer of this set of tasks, which share a linear memory, to the host
  - in general, futures and streams can be arbitrarily nested in both parameters and results
- example passing through a parameter
  - taking a future through and forwarding it on
- something more realistic: a streaming file write
  - forward the finished-writing task on


Q: Is there a difference between a read and a write handle to a stream?
A: Yes, when you create the task, you also get a subtask which represents ownership of the consuming end of the stream. Slightly analogous to a pipe, but there’s no buffer or any of that

Q: So there’s no type distinction?
A: Right. Just whether it is a return or a parameter. You can take language-level readable and writable streams and map them down to this, though. In theory could have the other direction too, but doesn’t seem strictly necessary, and adding the other direction of polarity seems just confusing and adds the need to make an arbitrary choice as an API designer.

- Concurrent export calls
  - example of doing synchronous reads and writes from C
  - leads us to cooperatively interleaved native and shadow stacks
  - you can decide not to support it by having an input stream and output stream and you can’t be reentrant, instead things are called from the start
- Commands vs reactors
  - commands entered once
  - reactors reentrant
- Core wasm stack switching
  - under active development
    - CG meeting
    - V8 implementation work
  - low-level primitives for a number of control flow constructs
  - sketch of canonical abi wired up to this proposal

Q: What exactly is this `cur_eventloop`? How do we know it’s None before calls?
A: Global scope in our component instance. It shouldn’t be clobbered, we should always be updating it as we go along lifting and notifying.

Q: So these shouldn’t be reentered?
A: Yes! And this reflects that property in the component model docs. You may suspend but not get reentered.

- Task scheduling
  - Found that it had to be defined
  - The task tree is the scheduler state
  - Each iteration, one of the following transitions happens (nondeterministically)
    - host calls a component export
    - progress on a host leaf task
    - copy values from a writing/returning subtask to a listening supertask
    - notify done tasks
    - only if none of the above apply: allow partial read/write notification
    - only if none of the above apply: block
  - thus, two-level scheduling
    - inter-component via the scheduler loop
    - intra-component via the language runtime (or whatever! in the core wasm
- Task cancellation
  - canonical abi builtin for it
    - can’t just delete the task, have to unwind all the state up the tree
    - can’t just call it “once”
      - may legitimately need to schedule async work to unwind
    - need it to be cooperative, in general
      - note that we need a different and bigger scope for non-cooperative failure anyway (“blast zone”)
  - cancellation adds a new cancel state that tasks can transition to before finishing
    - still can’t drop etc too soon
  - can map down from language-level constructs
    - explicit, like JS AbortController
    - implicit, maybe like JS GC collecting an unresolved progress
  - working through interactions between concurrent cancellation and listening
  - other aspects of cancellation
    - unlistening, introducing backpressure, less than cancelling an entire stream
    - unlisten, unwrite, unreturn
- The bonus question: How does stream teeing work?
  - Wrap it up next time, with summary
