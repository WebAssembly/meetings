### Toying around with wasi-sql (impromptu addition to fill time for tech difficulties)

**Bailey Hayes:** Toying around at KubeCon. Name up for discussion. Go might look like this, Ts might look like this. Question is: How would we convert this to something that is portable. A lot of ways that we might be able to do this. Back to Go example, Go has a database API. That’s what this one is coded to. There would be some downsides to creating the amount of APIs you would need. ALso contrary to other idaes liek wasi-data. What would it look like for minimal amount of work but that’s still portable. 

A component imports wasi-sql and specifies what driver it uses. Benefit here is that we get out of the business of defining what they can do. The driver could attach to drivers for MySQL or Posgres. Could have modules in the browser that could run against indexDB, or against an HTTP endpoint. If they are running on socket-enabled platfgorm, that would be bound.

This isn’t quite ready yet, this is just something I’m toying with. Love to hear opinions. Don’t really love the idea that you have to specify your own SQL dialect. Want to have computational DAGs. That’s where we’d get most extensibility. High-level goal is for interop.

**Lin Clark:** Thank you for sharing,

**Jiaxiao Zhou:** Is this in Wasm

**Bailey Hayes:** This would be WASI. I expect that this would only be used with module linking. I don’t know the exact syntax of the component model. That’s why it’s just sketched out now. Goal would be for it to be defined by wit.

**Petr Penzin:** I think this would be an API for accessing SQL. 

**Bailey Hayes:** Yes, possible that it could be that query could fall back to grpc.

**Jiaxiao Zhou:** Could you please elaborate on SQL syntax. 

**Bailey Hayes:** So I expect you to have a string that is defined in wit as a query string. I think wasi-query is maybe a better name.

**Kevin Moore:** My understanding is that WASI stuff is that it covers sys level stuff

**Lin Clark:** Yes, it has evolved since then for other APIs useful for portability

**Bailey Hayes:** This was created in response to someone doing string interpolation

**Jiaxiao Zhou:** Is this public on Internet?

**Bailey Hayes:** I’ve cloned template but will put it up. One Problem is if you have to register drivers. 

**Chris Suszynski:** Could you show once again what function call returns?

**Bailey Hayes:** Typical query returns a result, which would be a stream. Because we know what the schema is, we can return something that is its own struct type. It would have bool, string, etc. That would mean that we could have strong types across the stack, great for optimization

**Bailey Hayes:** To be clear, this sketch mostly came from Luke. Lin, we can move forward next meeting?

### Poll for wasi-native-threads
**Alexandru Ene:** I did a presentation last time. Main idea would be to add native threads to Wasm. There’s a couple of tricky design choices, but we could proceed with cloning module instance when we create new thread and take the hit for mem consumption. I had a chat with the people who work on adding a new instruction and qualifier based on the weakening wasm paper. It’s quite likely that this would be forward-compat. If wasm adds an attr, they have to define what happens when module doesn’t have that attr. That’s one tricky design choice. Another is that first proposal would only have spawn, quite similar to pthread create. There would be quite a bit of interest in having special functions for join, detach, cancel because it would simplify life of implementers. So far pthread create is only there because join could be wasm atomics. I haven’t fully fleshed out, I don’t know for this phase if it’s necessary. I have todos in there for what we want to support, and todo for whether it’s one function or more. 

**Lin Clark:** Good question. Not necessary for this phase.

**Alexandru Ene:** The tricky design choice would not change the API. It might change some behavior if wasm standard evolves in a way that is incompoatible.

**Dan Gohman:** As I was researching, browser case, new worker has to return to event loop before create new worker. We may need to change API for browser.

**Petr Penzin:** So if there was no join, that’s not a problem.

**Dan Gohman:** Mutex wait 

**Petr Penzin:** Mutex wait is out of scope

**Dan Gohman:** But it wouldn’t work. Need to figure out if we would change the design for the browser case.

**Alexandru Ene:** Some ideas around polyfilling. Might be a case where it isn’t compat with the browser. I don’t know if we can do that. Emscripten can do that right?

**Dan Gohman:** Can create pool up front. Can proxy to a worker instead of main thread. In EM, the way that works is that JS does a bunch of work, and we’d need to discuss API

**Petr Penzin:** I think we were talking about doing it the emscripten way

**Dan Gohman:** What I’m saying is that it wouldn’t be possible to have a library polyfill. You could do an Asyncify rewrite.

**Petr Penzin:** I don’t think this is what you meant by polyfill. It exists with all the limitations right now. I don’t think we want it to solve the problem of the main thread cannot be blocked

**Dan Gohman:** I’m responding to a goal in there. It seems like it isn’t enough 

**Alexandru Ene:** I can adjust it to say that it will work

**Dan Gohman:** But what will work

**Alexandru Ene:** Today we can solve it by creating the threads up front and dispatching work. That bit would stay the same. 

**Dan Gohman:** Ok, so you’d plan to polyfill with up front pool.

**Alexandru Ene:** Yes, and I can adjust the text to say that more clearly.

**Andrew Brown:** I think that what this clarified for me is that it is a goal to polyfill for browsers. There must be a solution for this to get to later.

**Alexandru Ene:** Is that correct? Do these have to work across browsers

**Dan Gohman:** We’ve been saying that every API defines its own requirements. It’s desirable

**Lin Clark:** And that’s before Phase 2

**Till Schneidereit:** We want as many wasi APIs as possible to be virtualizable. That’s clearly not possible for multi-threading

**Alexandru Ene:** It would be more compat once we have shared attrs on globals. It gets closer to outside browser scenario.

**Till Schneidereit:** What I guess is different is that it’s fundamentally about sharing memory. Normally components have shared nothing linking between them. That’s very diff for this proposal. For most cases, the question of whether it can run in the browser is a different question. For most WASI APIs, the answer should be to run in browser—worst case having fully virtualized. We clearly can’t require full virtualizability here. But we shouldn’t go all the way to the other direction. We should have the host call for spawning a thread be implmentable in terms of web semantics.

**Alexandru Ene:** Is it sufficient to work with a thread pool? I guess we can figure that out later.

**Lin Clark:** Ok, ready to poll. This will be a consensus poll. Any objections? No? Great, we have a new WASI proposal!
