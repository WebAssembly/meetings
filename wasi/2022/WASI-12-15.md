### Notes

#### "wasi-messaging updates" from Danilo (Dan) Chiarlone.

wasi-messaging update & wasi-sql
 
Joe: It would be good to have comparisons of the different implementations, as there are many subtle differences.
https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning/tree/main/crates/messaging/src/implementors
 
Dan: Good idea; we can add those to the documentation.
 
#### "wasi-sql" from Danilo (Dan) Chiarlone, and Ivan Towlson.

wasi-messaging update & wasi-sql

Bailey: It would be really great to reach out to more database people.

Dan: Agreed!

Dan G.: Can you talk through the motivation question briefly?

Dan: Having one interface that covers multiple implementations has value

Bailey: We want capability-driven APIs. Hosts want to delineate what types of capabilities we give to guest code; sockets are a wide pipe; wasi-sql is more specific. This gives us better tools for detecting SQL injection attacks, in ways that works over all databases. And it helps us support “weird” languages.

Luke: This solves some problems without trying to solve all problems, and that has value. It’s abstracting over some of the mechanics without fully abstracting over the database semantics. For example, wasi-keyvalue potentially abstract over different implementations, while wasi-sql exposes more of the semantics of the specific implementations.

Websql failed because in browsers, it would be necessary to fully spec the database semantics. (see https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase for details). But for this proposal, we can treat the sql query string as just a string.

Joe: Does anyone know why were all implementors of web database proposal use the same Sqlite?
Was it the case that designers of web database found it difficult to standardize a SQL interface that works for most use cases of most sql databases?

Luke: Several (all? I forget, but at least Firefox and Chrome) were already embedding sqlite for browser-internal purposes (e.g., managing 
And the difficulty wasn’t even attempting to abstract over multiple databases, but even just precisely defining the semantics of the subset (b/c you don’t want to expose, e.g., vacuum) to expose to web content

Should we rename wasi-sql to reflect that it isn’t actually limited to SQL databases?

[discussion generally positive, but no specific name was chosen]

Dan: Should we factor out error types into a separate interface?

Luke: We do want to avoid having a one-big-enum-for-everything. Precise error codes help people do case analysis. Perhaps there could be a resource for representing a generic error with a string and backtrace. Though we’ll always want these interface-specific errors

Chris Woods: Is there a component-model plan for a common error code?

Luke: No; the plan is to encourage interface-specific errors.

Chris: It can be very convenient for users of interfaces to have common codes. It’s a tradeoff. And wrapping one component interface in another, forcing all the interfaces to have a shared error code space makes it clear how to map them.

Kyle B: I wonder if wit gives us an opportunity to be more precise.

Luke: Enums can be packaged up as nested arms 

[discussion about factoring out a general-purpose error type, with a string message, backtrac, and maybe other opaque debugging features]

Dan: Maybe I’ll make up a proposal
