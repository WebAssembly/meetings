### Closing out wasi-parallel from last meeting

**Andrew Brown:** Since we brought up wasi-parallel, met with Bailey and SS and Luke. Both meetings really productive. Brought up questions and potential solutions and ways of using. Want to thank them. Trying to get POC code as a Wasntime branch. Ran into issues with wiggle, pinged Alex. Don’t think final solution will be pretty, but will let people play with it. Then can figure out right way to fix. We published the spec at https://github.com/abrown/wasi-parallel-spec so that people can look at that. Started populating the issues with stuff we’ve discussed, will add more soon. Issues there are place to go for discussion.

Other thing is whether to vote for Phase 1. Don’t think that’s a critical step, but we’d be ready.

**Lin Clark:** IIRC any vote has to be on the agenda 7 days in advance. I agree that you’re ready, so let me know when you want to put it on.

### Closing out async discussion from last meeting

**Luke Wagner:** Last time we stopped at cliff hanger, will give brief review. Let’s start with basic stream. Why can’t we just have stream. What happens when A imports fetch from B? What if we could do this with simple module linking. When A read how does be get to run and write those butes. Separate thread? That’s how it usually works today. I think problem is that the threads are not ideal for being mandatory when you’re composing components. Add racy non-determinism. Also have context switching and sync overhead. And now have a dependency on threads. And in a serverless context, don’t need more scheduling units. Already have embarrassingly parallel model. Nice write up on this from Joe Duffy from Midori, talking specifically about too much stuff to schedule.

Instead, I think we want control flow to be deterministically transferred to B. That sounds a lot like corountines or callbacks. But how does that show up in IT?

Proposal is not directly. Let’s say new stream type that can be added in the signature. Basically a list passed incrementally over the course of the async call. Stream has two ends, writer and reader. When I pass, The caller gets the writer and the callee gets the reader. On return, it’s the reverse. Thus the ends are local to a single component instance. Just like futures, the canonical ABI defines ops on the reader and writer ands.

Stream built-ins [slide]. Basically lifting WASI I/O streams into IT.

**Piotr Sikora:** I think the "normal" read/write versions could be expressed using the same prototypes as the "short" versions if you pass min=len.

**Luke Wagner:** Dan has thought about that

**Dan Gohman:** Short read and short write have non-determinism built in

**Syrus Akbary:** Why having skip built-in rather than as a layer on top the read api? (Kind of stream -> filtered stream)

**Luke Wagner:** optimization

**Vibhav Pant:** Question about handle itself. In this case, it’s an i32. Any reason this can’t be extern ref?

**Luke Wagner:** Decreases dependency on future proposals. From perspective of C compiler, can treat this as an int. Even though this looks forgable, can only forge to your own table.

**Dan Gohman:** In the witx description, not i32. Canonical ABI is just toolchain

**Vibhav Pant:** Another small question. Idea is that one doesn’t want to stick to a single concurrency model. Could I implement these in my engine in a way that preempts the caller.

**Luke Wagner:** With ABI=callback you can do either. Blocking needs to happen somewhere, either in host or in your greenthread. So you have a lot of flexibility if you use greenthreads. If your engine only has callback, you’ll only be able to use that ABI.

Before talking about canonical ABI need to talk about deadlocks.

Deadlocks [slide] How can we avoid deadlocks by design? When we create a new coroutine, coroutine lifetime is tied to the stream.

Now let’s see how it shows up in canonical ABI. [slide]

Let’s see what an actual concrete component in wat would look like. Example streaming component [slide]

**Ben Titzer:** So these components all get encoded into an extended import section… these all become part of the binary.

**Luke Wagner:** Yes, embedded in that binary is the core. Then this format is like a container for holding one or more core module.

**Syrus Akbary:** Can we have the slides uploaded somewhere and liked from the docs? Thanks

**Lin Clark:** As Piotr pointed out last time, slides are already in the agenda for last meeting.

**Luke Wagner:** So that’s a single component. Let’s talk about composability. Async streaming composition example [slide]

Let’s look at what async looks like in the JS API [slide]

What about stream in the JS API [slide]

**Vibhav Pant:** One small question—idea is that this will plug into any langs runtime irregardless of how it handles concurrency, right? 

**Luke Wagner:** Yes, in some langs might not have abstraction like JS does with stream, but hopefully we’ve given you the primitive to build it

**Vibhav Pant:** So by design it is agnostic?

**Luke Wagner:** Yes, as much as possible

So that’s the base proposal. A few expected additions [slide]

Final thoughts [slide] Callbacks are kind of like the async version of goto. Even if ones implements this as callbacks, specifying in times of these virtualized coroutines gives us structured concurrency for those callbacks.

**Vibhav Pant:** One small question about async resources. Kind of remind me of async traits in Rust. Am I correct in assuming that since stream handles are concrete types, the whole problem that Rust has with boxing. 

**Dan Gohman:** I’m not familiar with the problem in Rust.

**Vibhav Pant:** One issue with async traits in Rust… futures in Rust are essentially trait futures. If you want to do async traits in Rust, you have to box them. Because in this design, because stream handles are i32, does having async resources not have the same problem.

**Alex Crichton:** I think this does help and not help. The trait problem in Rust is very specific to Rust. WASI is going to give us all of the concrete things, but probably going to abstract in Rust. Up to languages how best to bind.

**Luke Wagner:** You might have noticed that I used backtick T. Not a witx thing, but way of showing that this isn’t a generic interface. It becomes concrete once it’s in a component. The built-ins doing reads and writes are monomorphic. Statically known element type.
