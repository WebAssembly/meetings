### Canonical ABI impact on WASI
**Dan Gohman:** Luke gave a presentation about lightweight component model. How do these relate to the core spec model. Luke has great slide on linking dynamism. Question of do we put in core spec. LW component model is saying we’ll put it in a new layer.

Comp model gives us all the great things in Wasm. Just imports and exports, really great property. Sandboxing and port comes with that. But Wasm Doesn’t have perfect story for black box reuse. Linear memory is often exported, but that’s often dependent on toolchain you’re using. Hard to know how organized if you don’t know what language. Idea for a long time of abstracting this (e.g. sharing slice). Would be somewhat more organized, but the slices has problems of lifetimes. Without any knowledge of how long the slice lives, hard to deal with this. CM solves this using IT and shared nothing linking. Shared state is shared in very tight boundaries. This gives us much more flexibility in defining interfaces between modules.

Another recent PR is canonical ABI proposal (in IT repo). IT has this type system, types like list, variant, string, signed/unsigned ints. Canonical ABI lowers into core wasm types. This has a number of ramifications. Allows us to move forward with IT before adapter functions are ready. Adapter functions can create optimized bridged between internal types and IT. We’re looking for a way to move forward getting a lot of benefits without waiting.

Canonical ABI also gives WASI a way to support engines that don’t support IT.

Two big concepts in IT are handles and resources. Handles are abstract handles, unforgable. These come across as i32 handles that are indices into a table. In the future, we’ll switch to C-ABI, but now we’ll have a more rigorous foundation.

[Example of wasi-io read function]

Can say that handles are at a layer below us. This will turn into a param of i32 handle. WASI won’t have to think about how things work, e.g. strings.

Another major concept is buffers. This is a new take on memory slice problem. Gives us a clear lifetime. Temporary views on memory buffers. Lifetime of the call. Pull buffer is read interface. Write is a push because. This solves ambiguity. Only valid to use within this call. Essentially like a borrow.

One unfortunate side effect: doesn’t support vectored IO. Question to answer: How important is it to have vectored IO?

So handles and buffers are the two main interesting concepts. With this, we can just focus on being an API instead of how to lower.

WITX is evolving into an IDL. Can describe core Wasm types, components, and components with full adapters. This allows us to just focus on semantics.

So that’s whirlwind tour, any questions?

**Piotr Sikora:** Observation. C-ABI way of borrowing is very similar to what we originally used in proxy-wasm. In very last iteration had started moving away to align with WASI, seems it won’t be necessary.

We skipped free part and moved ownership to Wasm module itself so if it wants to keep the data, it can. 

**Luke Wagner:** If I remember correctly, C-ABI in current version only frees if it’s returned to the caller.

**Piotr Sikora:** [pondering] do callbacks make a difference? Who’s on the stack, you mean…

**Luke Wagner:** When Wasm is calling an import, it’s on the stack, and then returning to the host. For same reason you said, I think it’s a good use case.

**Sam Clegg:** I’m curious where in the process you see removal of full shared memory. Where does that fit in timeline?

**Dan Gohman:** A few diff options. Way proposal is shaping up, we have components and core wasm stuff. Components won’t export their linear memory. Components are for shared nothing use cases. That’s what gets us this black boxing.

**Sam Clegg:** That’s the line we draw. Core Wasm is shared everything. Components mean it’s shared nothing.

**Luke Wagner:** What’s kind of nice is that compiling core Wasm, you don’t need to care because you’re either wrapped in a component that will hide internal details for you, or you don’t need to hide internal details.

**Piotr Sikora:** So should we assume that C-ABI is a requirement.

**Dan Gohman:** At this moment, still a PR on IT. I can’t speak for what the IT or Wasm CG will decide. Should be careful to say that I think these are really attractive for WASI.

**Piotr Sikora:** Let’s assume that CG approves C-ABI, should we assume that we’re dependent on C-ABI?

**Dan Gohman:** I would suggest that. A lot of the APIs wouldn’t change that much. Read and write would lose vectorability. But would all be very similar to today. It would basically work in terms of core wams.

**Luke Wagner:** We could publish both the IT and C-ABI versions from witx. 

**Dan Gohman:** Should talk about how to present core wasm version.

**Piotr Sikora:** Would C-ABI version have mallac and free?

**Dan Gohman:** We’d need to have in the toolchain. Wasi-libc would offer that.

**Luke Wagner:** From a core abi perspective, here all the things you can import, these are the things you must export. Both could be in this core wit file.

**Andrew Brown:** Just want to add a 1+ for that. Having some official way to translate witx down to core wasm is useful for those of us implementing.
**Dan Gohman:** Agreed

**Piotr Sikora:** One more question. Do we expect to use malloc/free for all data, or just for buffer.

**Dan Gohman:** Only buffer and only where you need dynamic.

**Luke Wagner:** Definitely the case only when it’s needed, but I think that’s not necessary for buffers because just a pointer to linear memory. Only cases are where a dynamically sized bit of data is coming into the instance.

**Dan Gohman:** In particular, won’t be calling malloc on every read call. No extra allocation or copy

**Piotr Sikora:** I worry that there might be inconsistencies. Some will get dynamically allocated data.

**Dan Gohman:** It will be on the application to get it right. This is how C works, on your own to manage your memory. Other languages can manage it for you. Between programmer and toolchain. 

**Luke Wagner:** Will have a baseline of safety with sandboxing of linear memory

### Classic commands
**Dan Gohman:** WASI has commands and reactors. This is where we say FD 0, 1 and 2 are in/out/error, that _start is command start function. I’m now calling these classic commands. Preserving core wasm API for things that don’t use components. These all fall in the same bucket, this is where definition of command/reactor can go. Components subsume this.

Do people have thoughts about collection this whole realm of how we run things today into this one repo and then clearing way for components to be new clean ABI. Some ambiguity today where you export functions that aren’t part of _start, many engines will just ignore them. We don’t really want programs to depend on having their other exports being called.

**Sam Clegg:** Are you thinking that because reactors haven’t really been adopted we don’t need parallel repo?

**Dan Gohman:** If people are still using reactors, then we can keep that around, but components solve the use case they were designed for.

**Piotr Sikora:** In proxy-wasm reactors we use std-out. Would be good if that isn’t specific to commands. 

**Dan Gohman:** Both commands and reactors have that, so I’d keep that together.

**Dan Gohman:** Do these two things seem like generally good ideas or would people like to see more discussion.

**Andrew Brown:** I’d be in favor of C-ABI side, don’t really understand the classic ABI stuff.

**Dan Gohman:** Classic ABI stuff works but isn’t pretty. If implementing toolchain, need to know, but others don’t.

**Andrew Brown:** And you don’t think it fits in tool conventions?

**Dan Gohman:** Good question. I think this does more because it defines contract between toolchain and engine. Feels like it’s a lower level thing.

**Andrew Brown:** Makes sense. So easily convinced to be in favor.

**Johnnie Birch:** I think I missed this. Is classic ABI meant to be long term.

**Dan Gohman:** I think I’m not really ready to call that. Components are really cool. If classic ABI needs to evolve, then putting them in a box makes it easier to do that because they interact in subtle ways. If we wanted to evolve to incorporate typed main, we could do that, so collecting them together allows us to do that.

**Andrew Brown:** Sorry to bikeshed where to put these things. Hard to keep track of the repos.

**Lin Clark:** For context, we're working on streamlining the wasi repo since it's the base for all proposals.

**Dan Gohman:** Could solve with links

**Lin Clark:** Hoping to tackle navigability over the next few months.

**Dan Gohman:** Nothing really needs to be decided at the moment, but I'm going to call this as consensus to move forward for now.

**Lin Clark:** So that's it for the agenda. Any other thoughts before we wrap up?

**Luke Wagner:** If I have a list of buffers, that could be vectored right?

**Dan Gohman:** Thought about that this morning. With adapter functions, vectored could be part of that. Probably some details to figure out.

**Luke Wagner:** Good point, multiple good options here

**Sam Clegg:** C-ABI has list?

**Dan Gohman:** Yes, has all the IT types.
