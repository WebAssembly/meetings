### WASI data

**Bailey Hayes** Principal Engineer at SimpleStore, database. Been tossing around an idea internally. For wasi-data, idea to support embarrassingly parallel data streams. Working well beyond gigabyte scale, and IO bound. Scale means distributed. Things tend to fall over, so needs to be resilient. We’d have record types for a dataset, a row.

Map reduce is special set of split, combine, etc. This brings compute to the data. Early one is Hadoop. Flink adds a ton of different operators. … Also threw in Apache Bean here. Level of sprawl that’s happening on how to run analytics on data is kind of a problem.

When talking about a distributed map reduce problem, lots of ways to connect. For Hadoop, distributed fs, ours is distributed database. Quite a bit of data sharding happening. That means there’s a runtime that knows where the data is. Wasi-data shouldn’t fill exactly that gap. You write your mapper, etc in your preferred lang, then load into distributed runtime. Those systems would have Wasm runtime.

For a lot of data scientists, they need it to be whatever tool they know. Also talking about heterogeneous architectures. Also need isolation to run in managed service. Can’t take down the database. Because of work in IT, being able to compose wasm modules is really interesting too. We’d be able to have the same module run virtually anywhere. WHy WASI, typically need to integrate with hardware acceleration etc.

End with an example. We would want these to be structured, strongly typed, and hopefully ergonomics would be solid. Finding the through line through all of these existing runtimes.

**Francis McCabe:** What’s the relationship between what you’re working on and event analysis?

**Bailey Hayes** A lot of these platforms are event driven. You’re perhaps thinking about constant time, that’s also relevant.

**Francis McCabe:** Let me make sure I understand correctly. Don’t mean crypto.

**Bailey Hayes** A lot of times with a database you have the same concerns that crypto has. Don’t want to expose the system clock.

**Luke Wagner:** Thanks, really interesting. I like your intuition, seems right on. For dev ergonomics, is there a driver script on the outside, and then there’s an inner layer of Wasm modules.

**Bailey Hayes** I think you described it really well. I imagine initial approach will be modelled on how things work today. One wasm module exposing several functions. Nice that you have some caching involved. When you’re distributing this kind of thing, lots of problems with global state.

**Luke Wagner:** That also sounds right on. How do you imagine this being exposed to the programmer, since we won’t have distributed global vars?

**Bailey Hayes** Finely data flow does this well. …

**Luke Wagner:** Are you imagine people composing different langs?

**Bailey Hayes** I think absolutely people will take off the shelf with a variety of languages coming together.

**Ralph Squillace:** First time thinking about this space, really enjoyed, lots to chew on

**Andrew Brown:** Great presentation, thanks. Over at Intel, we’ve been thinking about similar things on a single machine. We’re thinking about a parallel API that might be able to compare and contrast. Can probably present next time. Separate from wasi-nn. We realized that there’s a separable problem.

### Interface Types updates

**Alex Crichton**: Current status of interface types plus some work I’ve been doing on tooling, and how all effects WASI.

Overview—IT isn’t yet a formal spec, so WASI is kind of using it, kind of not. Given lack of target, kind of there, kind of not. Moving away from a C like def, moving towards what it actually is. Moving towards of official IT means that there will be some breaking changes. Lots of code generators, in between.

Where’s IT currently? General idae is making the set of types that Wasm is working with much richer.

Main thing is that it isn’t going to be as ambitious as Wasm, but about defining interfaces. This isn’t specific to any language. That’s why the type grammar is pretty general. Another thing is that IT is very abstract. Finally IT are big on virtualization and seamless language support. Additionally, whenever you’re using this, no raw memory manipulation. I should just give you a string and something in the middle should figure that out.

IT explainer is a little outdated. What we’re intending to do is base on module linking, which is based on component module, which means this is a wrapper around a core wasm module. So IT doesn’t have a binary format yet, no engine impl yet, type grammar still in flux.

We have type grammar (slide)

The big thing about IT is that values are always valid. Records always have all their fields, enums have one of the constants, when you get something you don’t have to validate that it’s correct. Most interesting part comes around handles and push and pull buffers. Handles are supposed to be like extern refs but a little diff. When you import a handle, I’m guaranteed that it’s owned by someone else. Today, there’s indirection. Whenever you receive a handle, you don’t have to check that it’s valid. For push and pull buffers, these are meant for cases like read or write on things like files. WASI will primarily use for bytes, but can also use them for records.

Today, WSI is defined with s-expressions. Has downsides around readability and maintainability. Working on a curly brace version of this. New syntax is not going to 100% correspond to what IT is going to be. I mentioned that IT is a layer around the module. This is one half of the story. We’re saying you can import/export. Some of this is still in flux, but witx is one of these two halves.

**Francis McCabe:** One of the early discussions was whether IT was beginning of IDL or not.

**Luke Wagner:** This isn’t intended to be a text format for IT. Functionally equivalent to the s-expression. This might have more context once I get to the end

**Francis McCabe:** I have a comment. I think it’s fine for you to invent your IDL.

**Luke Wagner:** It is an IDL in a way, but compiles down to IT.

**Till Schneidereit:** I think a good way to think for purpose of this group is to compare with formalization used in the wasm core spec where that’s an invented mechanism that isn’t itself standardized. This is more an editors affordance. Purely talking about the syntax. Same way to think about this here. It’s the way editors write out the API for the standardized WASI APIs.

**Alex Crichton**: Next thing is a recent development—canonical ABI. So far talked about how IT isn’t talking about memory representation of types. Adapter functions can lift and lower. Problem with this is that adapter functions are going to take a while. Intention in the meantime is to have a canonical ABI. This is a temporary stop-gap. Will likely be used for a long time. Gives us something that we can work on today, and in the future with adapter functions then it can be optimized. So canonical ABI today mostly matches the C ABI. How do we productively define WASI in terms of IT today.

For Scalars/Records/Variants, do what C does. Strings are considered a specialization of list of chars. Rep of list is 2 32 bit ints. Handles and push/pull buffers (slide) Green boxes are validated by the runtime. Blue boxes are what you control. All modules have access to clone and drop. Memory management is implied here, done through realloc and free. Not required for ags to imports, which means when you’re calling module doesn’t need an allocator.

The glue around the module is what’s going to validate. This is all trusted code. This is not considered part of the trust boundary.

Talk about witx-bindgen. This is generating the glue code, plus code in the wasm module itself which gives an easy way to use. Have a demo on the web.

Brief taste (slide). Nice idiomatic Rust generated for you. Similarly, if you want to run on the web, it would generate JS and TS.

These are the high-level goals (slide). This is interface agnostic, so should be relatively easy to add new languages.

Last thing is what’s next for WASI and IT. The CG will get more agreement on canonical ABI. Soon after that, WASI would move towards IT for this. All of WASI’s APIs would be defined in terms of IT.

**Francis McCabe:** Can I ask about pull/push buffers. Is it your understanding that people will access buffer through intrinsics.

**Alex Crichton**: I should preface that these are the most likely to change of all the types. They have diff representation in imports and exports. So yes intrinsics on import, not on export.

**Syrus Akbary**: Super awesome work. I have a few questions. I found import and export naming confusing. Maybe host guest? I have a question regarding timing. When do you think things are more mature.

**Alex Crichton**: This is something that will be driven by the Wasm CG. We want to follow what the CG does with IT. IT is still in flux. A lot of work to still be done there. So that is something that CG at large would have to answer.

**Till Schneidereit:** Regarding naming, this also applies to guest/guest.

**Alex Crichton**: I also find import/export naming confusing, so trying to think of different naming. Very much work in progress in these regards.

**Syrus Akbary**: Right now effort from other companies trying to define universal IDL. Think opp to define witx as a consumer for other IDLs.

**Alex Crichton**: If it works for other IDLs, free to use it.

**Luke Wagner:** The way that resources and handles work is likely to work differently in other IDLs.

**Alex Crichton**: One other hope is that 10 years from now no one thinks of witx-bindgen. No one should have to worry about witx when they’re developing wasm modules. The more everyone can forget about it, the better. We do have to think about it in the meantime, though.

**Ralph Squillace:** Speaking as someone from a megacorp defining IDLs, they’re critical, but they eventually go away.

**Till Schneidereit:** Should also be open to changing to formats, and shouldn’t have to standardize the tool using for standardizing.

**Francis McCabe:** IT is better viewed as a compilation target from an IDL. Don’t let IT take over the world. Instead it will work with everyone.

**Alex Crichton**: This is something for WASI in the interim state. IT is the standard.

**Syrus Akbary**: One thing I forgot to add. Is there anything we can help?

**Alex Crichton**: Probably mostly via the CG, pushing that forward. This is a difficult phase to help in witx-bindgen because thing is changing too rapidly. At least from my perspective, I dont’ want to go too far ahead of the standard so that decisions are made in the standard rather than de facto standardized in the tooling.

**Till Schneidereit:** Perhaps most valuable would be a completely separate implementation to validate that we aren’t boxing in 1 impl strategy for pushing the standard forward.
