### Poll: wasi-parallel

**Andrew Brown:** Currently spec is at abrown, but want to move to Wasm org because I’ll be out for 2 months. Also published a [POC implementation](https://github.com/abrown/wasmtime/tree/wasi-parallel).

Just a POC, ignore the hacks. Johnnie, Petr, and Mingqiu will be active on this while I’m out.

**Lin Clark:** consensus vote [no objections]

### Async and resources

**Luke Wagner:** Way back in Jan, gave preso about handles and resources. How do we pass opaque handles in a composable way. In May, talked about blocking and reconciling coroutine and callback style ABIs. In August, talked through async streaming. In that, proposal to generalize blocking to async effect. 

Lead user is HTTP API. If we can do it right for HTTP, I think it will pave the way for many other WASI APIs. Litmus tests are composability and bindability. 

Based on that, what’s still needed? [slide]

Resource methods [slide]

Any questions?

**Andrew Brown:** When you import foo, what does that look like in core wasm.

**Luke Wagner:** When we see the core wasm, I’ll get back to this question, but roughly looks like import of function with int. 

**Andrew Brown:** And import would be bar_foo?

**Luke Wagner:** Because you’re linking, you get to choose the name.

**Andrew Brown:** But you have to say the name you want to import, though.

**Luke Wagner:** Yeah, at the IT level, you would import resource R with foo… the whole thing.

**Vibhav Pant:** To the last point about virtual dispatching impl detail. Does that mean that how to dispatch is left to the language ABI. Doesn’t that mean this could impair interop?

**Luke Wagner:** Is there a specific kind of hazard that you’re thinking about?

**Vibhav Pant:** Since dispatch is left to each lang implementing in its own way, since you have different languages in the same app, that would impair?

**Luke Wagner:** My impression is that it will help interop because it’s a contract between two components. Whether it’s polymorphic dispatch or not is a detail of that language that’s on the other side of the call. What happens on the other side gets to be the languages decision. The constraint of specifying exactly what you’re calling opens up ___.

**Till Schneidereit:** Virtual dispatch doesn’t exist at component boundary. Only happens within a boundary. VD mechanism is fully encapsulated.

**Luke Wagner:** Yeah, that’s a good way to say it.

**Luke Wagner:** Resource constructors [slide]

**Ben Titzer:** Something special about type handle as R?

**Luke Wagner:** Yeah, that goes back to the Jan presentation. There’s a type constructor handle for any resource type R. ___. When you have multiple components, you have to care about lifetimes.

**Luke Wagner:** async constructor? [slide]

**Luke Wagner:** stream everywhere [slide]

**Luke Wagner:** Next I’ll show an example [slide]

**Luke Wagner:** Example resource impl [slide]

Here’s where I can arbitrarily create the string. These strings become an internal choice.

Invert this and that’s what the client sees.

**Andrew Brown:** Ok, I think I got it.

I had a question on the previous slide. Writer-func… what does zero mean

**Luke Wagner:** In general case, function pointer that gets instantiated ___. Zero is reserved. It means there is no writer function, second param is the stream. 

**Andrew Brown:** Let’s say we put number 42 there instead, what would that mean?

**Luke Wagner:** Have to be an index to a function ref in the funcref table.

**Till Schneidereit:** So functable needs to be 1-indexed?

**Luke Wagner:** Kind of nice to have zero not be a valid thing. 

**Luke Wagner:** Next steps [slide]

Any questions?

**Vibhav Pant:** Would uniqueness invariants be enforced statically?

**Luke Wagner:** Great question. Big constraint of Wasm is that it doesn’t have rich types, so can’t do constraint checking at boundary. With IT was can do it because handle already in semantics already has a ref count. Dynamic semantics can ensure at boundary. If your lang has static type checking, then you can rely on the langs safety checks.

**Vibhav Pant:** If this was imposed statically, could you opt it out?

**Luke Wagner:** It would be hard to tell the engine that it can trust without including this info.

**Till Schneidereit:** Also, langs like Swift have established pretty solidly that autoref counting at these kinds of boundaries are ok perf-wise. Components aren’t meant to be tiny-tiny.
