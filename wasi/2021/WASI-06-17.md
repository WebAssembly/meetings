**Lin Clark:** I had originally intended to only talk about how to improve the proposal authoring experience.

But as I was preparing slides, I realized that it might be good to do a more general check-in.

For the past few months, we've been talking through a lot of the technical decisions that are critical to all the work happening in the different proposals. 

And we’ve been talking through concepts that set up a foundation for the secure and composable kinds of interfaces that we want.

While we've been discussing all that, Alex has been churning away on tooling that will help WASI make the switch to Interface Types. And this work unblocks us in a lot of ways. We can now start pushing existing proposals to Phase 3, and it will be easier to get started on new proposals.

So for this meeting, I wanted to switch gears for just a little bit, away from the technical concept discussions, and talk more about process and how we're going to drive this work forward. 

And I see two parts in that discussion. Pushing forward the in-progress proposals and then getting more proposals in progress.

For the in-progress work, there are a few things on my radar that are high priority.


So one is wasi-io. Dan is going to be focusing on pushing wasi-io to Phase 3, 
as well as some of the other proposals that are close.

Another priority for a lot of the folks here—us at Fastly, but also Envoy, Microsoft and others—are HTTP APIs. 

Piotr presented a few meetings ago and then Luke presented a way to unify the various ways of handling async. 

Now that our team is wrapping up our work on moving WASI to Interface Types, we’re going to start prototyping how that unifying approach to async could work, and we can iterate on the shape of the various APIs from there.

So that’s what’s on my radar, I’ll also be reaching out champions for other proposals after the Interface Types change and if anyone is looking to push towards Phase 3, we can talk about next steps.

I’ll pause here and check—does anyone else want to give an update on their priorities?

Ok, so the next part looks past the immediate future and is more long term—Getting more proposals started.

For this, we need to make it easier to propose new APIs. When I was first coming on as co-chair, I asked a few people who were interested in proposing WASI APIs but hadn’t actually started doing it what challenges they were facing. 

And here are some of the things that I heard:
- Understanding the whole ephemeral vs standard thing is a challenge
- They were overwhelmed or confused by the repo structure
- Understanding the s-expressions used in witx is hard

We already talked about how to solve the first one as part of the modularization discussion. 

All of the work that would be considered ephemeral today will be happening outside of the WASI repo, in repos dedicated to the new module that's being proposed. Then, once a proposal has made it to Stage 5, it will be moved into the standards directory in the WASI main repo. 

On the second one… I’ll be going through and streamlining the main WASI repo. I mentioned this in passing in a call a couple of weeks ago, but I wanted to give everyone here more context for that.


First off, we already moved meetings out of the repo. 

We’ll be getting rid of phases with the move away from the ephemeral system. 

We’ve never used the proposals directory. We based it off of the way that the WebAssembly CG repo is set up, which uses that directory as an archive of the discussion around proposals, but the standards directory will cover that for us, so we’re just going to remove that.

Ideally, we’ll be able to remove the design directory longer term. That contains the command and reactor ABI doc, which will move to the classic commands repo that Dan has been talking about. 

And longer term, we plan to move optional imports to the component model. So once that’s done, we can get rid of this. And then we’ll be going through the docs directory and updating those docs to reflect the new way of doing things.

So that covers the second point. Any thoughts or questions on that?

Now for the third one. Someone who’s new to WASI looks at a WASI API and immediately bounces off of it because they can’t make heads or tails of it. So it would be better for those people who will be authoring new APIs to encounter a syntax that looks closer to most languages. 

This is really only a spec authoring concern, so we don’t need to come up 
with the most perfectly elegant syntax. But we should have something that’s more inviting and readily understandable to new API authors

Till had some ideas around this, so he worked with Alex to create a draft syntax 
and a prototype for tooling that can consume that syntax and turn it into bindings. And to test it out as an author, Dan converted the wasi-io proposal to use it. 

Here’s a snippet using s-expressions, and the alternative for comparison. 

We’d be happy if proposal authors want to take a look or try it out and see if there’s anything missing. The prototype is available in the witx-bindgen repo, and I’ll add a link to the chat in a moment.

So that’s it for what I have prepared. It felt like a good time to check-in on this process and roadmap stuff, especially since things will be picking up a bit now 
that Interface Types support is landing. Happy to take the remaining time to talk through all of this more.

**Piotr Sikora:** WebAssembly is a moving target. Interface Types, Canonical ABI, Stack Switching, etc. It’s hard to design APIs around so many moving parts.

**Lin Clark:** The Canonical ABI is supported in witx-bindgen that Alex is working on. But in general, yes, a lot of pieces are still moving.

**Till Schneidereit:** Yes, it’s a huge challenge. The goals of the Canonical ABI and this new witx-bindgen are to pull together enough pieces to get to an island of stability. The goal is to get to a robust environment and production quality fairly soon, with enough design room built in to allow iteration going forward.

**Lin Clark:** It would be good to find a way to give new proposal authors the needed context to work in this new environment.

**Andrew Brown:** There have been a bunch of different tools for working with witx APIs; is witx-bindgen the new official tool now?

**Till Schneidereit:** Right now, the tooling in the WASI repo has the witx crate contains support for the current s-expression syntax and APIs, and witx-bindgen can be a tool for working with the new syntax and the canonical ABI for future snapshots.

**Andrew Brown:** Which tool should proposal authors focus on?

**Till Schneidereit:** witx-bindgen should be the main tool going forward.

**Andrew Brown:** When we we expect the canonical ABI PR to be merged?

**Luke Wagner:** We’re still waiting on some details, but we should hopefully be good to merge after the CG meeting next week.

**Till Schneidereit:** And this will unblock us from basing the next WASI snapshot on it, even if the ABI continues to evolve beyond that point.
