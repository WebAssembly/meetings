### Walkthrough of converting a proposal to the new syntax

**Dan Gohman:** First proposal is clocks, very simple so wanted to convert for that purpose.

This is a conversation of original wasi-clocks that was based on the prev model, where you’d have a fork of the original WASI repo. One of the recommendations we’ve been hearing in WASI is that we don’t need a central repo. 

I think this will help a lot because the proposals are pretty cluttered. In this, we just have tests, the README that explains it, and spec. In this case, all the tooling is external.

Lin created a wasi-proposal-template that people can use to clone. This is an example, just filled in all the blanks. 

The Phase 4 criteria hasn’t actually yet been approved by this group. We expect that proposals will vary on portability needs. 

We have a brief intro, I didn’t put a ton of content here. We have goals. Very importantly, we have non-goals in here as well to be clear about scope. 

We have an API walk-through. We have a detailed design discussion, and stakeholder interest and feedback. I probably should say more here, but for now just showing the flavor. Acknowledgements also needs more work.

Most important part is the wai.md file. The markdown file is kind of an envelope format with the wai in code blocks. Three slashes is for documentation comments that autogenerate end user documentation.

Interesting question about how much detail WASI proposals should go into. At this time, wasi-clocks is depending a lot on additional external standards. If we need to go into additional detail, we can do that in markdown text under the code block. 

You’ll notice that you can also have markdown syntax in the code block. This would be rendered in end user tooling.

Any questions about the wai.md file?

**Lin Clark:** One thing we should clarify. Tossing around the name wai, that’s the new witx. Pat pointed out that we should rename it. It was wasm interface types extended, but now we’re just using interface types.

**Till Schneidereit:** Also we can expect to need to support both for a while, so the different names help differentiate.

**Vibhav Pant:** This kind of reminds me of Jupyter notebooks.

**Till Schneidereit:** I think that makes a lot of sense because one thing we’ve been talking about is besides the GitHub default rendering, having a different hosted site where you can post one of these URLs and it will show you the bindings for different languages, so you can actually look at this in the language of your choice.

**Dan Gohman:** One additional thing about how you use this file. This witx-bindgen tool (which we should rename) will be able to read this file directly. It will strip out the markdown parts and just extract the code blocks, concating together to create the actual bindings.

**Till Schneidereit:** We have a pull request open that strips the markdown.

**Dan Gohman:** wasi-random is another proposal in Phase 2. Same basic idea. I added more implementation details here.

Along with this, I’m developing a test harness.

**Vibhav Pant:** Is the idea that the harness is engine agnostic?

**Dan Gohman:** Yes, definitely the intention. Same command line arguments are already pretty common across different engines to run programs, so we’ll be able to plug them in.

**Vibhav Pant:** Will it be up to those engines to implement this harness?

**Dan Gohman:** There’s no fixed plan here. It seems to be the case that many current engines support the same arguments.

**Till Schneidereit:** As a matter of formalities, at some point it has to be up to engines to add their own support for this because it can’t be the responsibility of this group to do the work to support all of the engines.

**Dan Gohman:** Yeah, this is new territory. There’s a test harness in core. Every engine I’ve seen ends up building own test harness. We can do better than the core CG here because we’ll have more of a framework, but up to engines to work on their engine.

### Making it easier to draft WASI APIs, part 2

https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/450
https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/451
https://github.com/linclark/wasi-proposal-template

**Lin Clark:** We’ve been talking about how to make the process easier. Part of this is making releases more modular.

I put up an issue to [vote on next week](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/450). Instead of having a snapshot versioned by a single integer, we would version separately. This makes it possible to use semver.

I think these are separable questions—whether to split and whether to use semver.

Start with splitting. We’d add tools like GitHub actions to the template Dan just showed to make it easy to cut new releases. Any objections?

**Vibhav Pant:** Is there a chance this increases clunkiness?

**Lin Clark:** Do you mean for implementers?

**Vibhav Pant:** Potentially even for people using.

**Till Schneidereit:** I think it’s more of a toolchain concern.

**Vibhav Pant:** Yeah, I’ll need to come up with a more concrete example.

**Piotr Sikora:** Question—what happens with cross-component dependencies?

**Lin Clark:** We’d make it possible to specify the semver of what you’re depending on.

**Piotr Sikora:** What if you depend on one version of a component and have a transitive dependency on another version of it.

**Till Schneidereit:** Remains to be seen. Fully expect hosts will want to support both versions for backwards compat reasons anyway.

**Piotr Sikora:** While we’re on the topic, how do we expect version number to be exposed, because right now we use module names.

**Luke Wagner:** I like idea of putting version in module name string.

**Piotr Sikora:** Last question, right now we have a flat repo. Where would older versions be?

**Lin Clark:** This isn’t decided yet. I personally like using GitHub history for that, but others disagree. I should mention that this is open for discussion and should be what this group decides.

**Piotr Sikora:** As long as there is a convention that all the proposals follow.

**Lin Clark:** Next, using semver. We already got into this a little bit, but any concerns?

**Till Schneidereit:** I just want to flag what Sam Clegg brought up in the issue that patch versions aren’t a good fit.

**Lin Clark:** We actually could need patch versions. Came up in a discussion with someone. We’re going to be displaying comment text to end users. If a comment has something that’s unclear or a typo, that would be a patch.

So I think all levels in semver apply to us. We talked a lot about process for majors. You can see that [in my PR](https://github.com/linclark/WASI/blob/new-process/Proposals.md#versioning). Idea is that champions have a build a tool that implements old API in terms of new API. If they can’t, need to have a new name for the API.

**Till Schneidereit:** Idea is that implementers wouldn’t need to have two native implementations of the same API. They could use the virtualized version of the old API.

**Luke Wagner:** Might be a good reason to have all versions in GitHub directory structure. Then you could have a directory with old release plus tool.

**Lin Clark:** Will schedule a vote for next time.

### Continue from last meeting: Walk and talk through some example WASI component scenarios

**Luke Wagner:** ConditionallyNormalizingCache Rust impl [slide]

This is where I wanted to conditionally normalize to reduce cache hit ratio. 

Fifth component [slide ]

The next component I want to write is locking versions of all dependencies. 

ResolveConditionallyNormalizingCache.wasm [slide]
