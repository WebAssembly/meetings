For people taking notes, just type names; we’ll replace them with abbreviations before posting them publicly.

**Pat Hickey:** Github is now rolling out features to allow for renaming git branches from “master” to “main”, including blob url redirection. It’s mostly automatic, but it does require people to do some changes locally to update. We’ll put the steps in the WASI github issue tracking this.

Main topic: Testing.

**Lin Clark:** <slides>

The context here is WASI modularization -- breaking up the core WASI module into separate modules.

Pat and Dan are working on a new witx mechanism for expressing dependencies between witx files, allowing modules to depend on each other.

The main WASI repo will be the source of truth for stage-5 (standardized) proposals.

Tests should include both the source, in high-level languages, and compiled wasm binaries.

Things we still need to build:
A test runner
Tests. We’ll start with some tests from Wasmtime, and everyone can add tests.
