**Lin Clark:** Dan is going to give a talk on environment variables

**Dan Gohman:** Environment variables are an old POSIX thing that are embedded in a bunch of places. We use them because they are better than alternatives. Debian has a policy on how to use them (linked), one thing they assert is programs should have a good default if an environment variable is not present.

**Dan Gohman:** How should environment variables work in Wasi? Two categories of use cases: well known variables set by the system or a configuration system e.g. PATH, LANG, TZ, and then application specific environment variables. E.g. gnu ls recognizes LS_COLORS. Other applications use them for secrets, like AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Using variables for secrets is tricky, they can get leaked in the shell and other places.

**Dan Gohman:** Potential problems include: they have hidden effects. We want programs that are portable and statically analyzable. Programs don’t declare what environment variables they need, can lead to “Works for me” but doesnt work elsewhere.
**Dan Gohman:** The default environment variables contain a lot of interesting information, could be personally identifiable (home directory contains your name), path and time zone and operating system and hostname identify your machine as well.

**Dan Gohman:** Because environment variables are strings they may contain absolute paths or network addresses that require ambient authority to open. 

**Dan Gohman:** Portability is an issue, windows environment variables are pretty similar to unix but not exactly the same. String encoding is also an issue we wont get into here.

**Dan Gohman:** WASI’s conceptual tools for this sort of problem: we have my presentation from a few weeks ago about Typed Main, where argv strings are replaced with typed parameters. Another technique is programs could write a witx description of what it needs from the outside world. You can also use something like a preopen system, libc grabs handles behind the scene. Languages and toolchains need to opt into all of those.

**Dan Gohman:** I presented Handles in a march or april meeting, they are references to external resources. Handles are defined by a spec layer below WASI, WASI can just focus on defining its APIs in terms of Handles. These are a mechanism to avoid ambient authorities - rather than pass in absolute paths we can preopen and pass in a handle to a file.

**Dan Gohman:** The follow on to Handles was I/O Types. This gives us streams and arrays, which abstract over many of the useful things the underlying system can give us (e.g. networks, files, devices storage partitions, pipes). 

**Dan Gohman:** Finally we talked about Canonical ABI previously, it gives us a way to use Interface Types without the full power of adapter functions being ready to use yet. 

**Dan Gohman:** So now with all of those technologies I will present Typed Environment Variables. This mirrors the way Typed Main works. We want to cast environment variables as imports available to the program. At program build time, it declares it will import the values, so we can statically see what it needs.

**Dan Gohman:** When should we use imports vs when should we use arguments? These are two different domains to provide input to a program with no clear dividing line between the two. My intuition is: use arguments for things which would be arguments in a CLI, and imports for things which would be enviroment variables or ambient authority. Not a hard and fast rule but a good starting place.

**Dan Gohman:** Lets look at more use cases. Locale variables: LANG, LC_*, TZ. Many headless applications and libraries wont need to know these. We can define interface type enums for Language, Locale, Timezone so these can be imported with structure rather than by string. Maybe a single locale, timezone won’t even apply to an entire application, we don't need to tie that to the entire process scope, we have smaller modularity in WASI and we can get away from that. We can use an abstract timestamp type which doesn’t have an associated timezone, and only present it in terms of a time zone when the user needs it. For compatibility, libc can recreate the strings.

**Dan Gohman:** Another set of variables is the terminal config- TERM and NO_COLOR. There is this common environment that lots of programs expect to run in, for WASI to be portable we need to keep that environment consistent. Many programs already recognize “256color” in the term string so we can e.g. set `TERM=”wasi-256color”`. But that is a process wide symbol, what if we have a program talking to multiple terminals? We should scope the terminal setting to a terminal connection.

**Dan Gohman:** Temporary directories, TMPDIR. This hasn’t aged well in Unix, programs have to use random names and special protocols to stop from stomping on each other. It has been the source of many CVEs. TMPDIR doesnt preserve a lot of intent for what a program uses it for. Does the program need to create a file to pass it to another application? That requires your program and the next share the same view of the same filesystem. Ownership and lifetimes are not well defined, so systems need daemons to clean up old temporary files. THese are a symptom of what I call “filesystem oriented thinking”, if we need to solve “temporary storage outside programs address space” we can use io arrays for that. We can use and manage their lifetime in a very particular way. If you need to pass large objects between programs, you can use handles for this as well. We want to push programs away from assuming they have TMPDIR and towards using handles. Compatibility will be harder to emulate in libc. We can provide a TMPDIR to libc but that wont help us with sharing with other programs. We’ll likely need to have programs be modified to work for WASI when they need to pass a temporary file to another program.

**Dan Gohman:** HOME has so many things in it. Your ssh keys, your email, your browser history is all sitting there. In many virtualized container environments home may be empty. We need to drill down and have a program say what its doing with its home directory - is it a cache, is it a config. Special case thats harder to fit in the model is a user shell where the user is navigating their own files. We can put shells in their own box, that is not the general application platform use case, potentially shells can have their own separate APIs.

**Dan Gohman:** Path configuration- ways to run external programs. PATH, EDITOR, BROWSER, SHELL etc. so that the program can exec things. Very difficult to make portable or sandbox. For typical applications and libraries we should make them describe exactly what external resources they need - if they really need to launch an editor there should be an api for them to do that.

**Dan Gohman:** Arbitrary execing another program on the host system is maybe out of scope for WASI for today, its very difficult to do this in a sandboxed or portable way. but having a WASI program launch another WASI program is very much in scope. We want programs to express their intent to do one or the other of those things.

**Dan Gohman:** User config like LOGNAME, UID. sshing to a hostname makes use of this, it picks a username on the other end of the connection according to the local username. Wasi can define a DefaultUsername type that is imported for that ssh use case.

**Dan Gohman:** Application config like GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, LS_COLORS. The Twelve-Factor App recommends this approach for configuring applications. We want to allow applications to request arbitrary names, however, they should use imports with specific types, and we should deny well-known environment variables for security/privacy reasons e.g. LOGNAME. In this case, we can be compatible by having tooling translate its imports back into string environment variables.

**Dan Gohman:** Secrets are a special case of application config. We can add a Secret type for arbitrary bytes outside the instance, keep it behind a handle so that programs dont need to observe the secret itself and have special APIs to serialize them into HTTP request URLs or other things, as late as possible - potentially some sort of templating system. Different protocols may have different requirements for how and where secrets get interpolated. 

**Dan Gohman:** How does this look for developers? In the typed main story we pass in environment variables as a list of key-value string pairs. Next step up is the application developers write their own witx file to describe their imports. And finally we have language/toolchain integration. In my Nameless rust crate I have a demo of how typed main and environment variables will work with full language/toolchain integration. I have declared what environment variables this program uses with this special macro. When you compile this program for native, it uses regular environment variables to get these imports. When you compile it for WASI, it uses imports for the environment variables.

**Dan Gohman:** Any questions?

**Andrew Brown:** You mentioned environment variables as imports - how do we do optional imports in WASI/WebAssembly?

**Dan Gohman:** We defined a system for optional imports in WASI a long time ago and nobody implemented it or used it. We want Module Linking to provide a concept of an optional import. So whether we describe it in the WASI spec or Module Linking we will have some mechanism for this.

**Piotr Sikora:** Do we expect to use existing WASI apis to consume environment variables? One current problem is what if you need a configuration that is e.g. a table containing many megabytes of IP addresses, then it stays in memory for the lifetime of the process. What about a way to extract a single value from that table?

**Dan Gohman:** The current interface will be called “classic WASI”, when we move to typed main you can say, rather than import the value as a string you can import it as a typed object and then have additional getters defined which take the handle to that object.

**Sam Clegg:** Would these environmental imports be distinguished in some way or look like any other import?

**Dan Gohman:** I think they should look like any other import. When you need to run a program like this in a command line setting, if the wasi runtime cant satisfy the imports form what is available ambiently, they can be an optional value where it indicates it doesnt have them. The user’s agent gets a lot of flexibility on how it provides these variables, it can report an error to the user or prompt for the input - that is up to the user agent, not the program developer. Imports are sort of like environment variables - your language doesnt change, your git username doesnt change, whereas you pass in different arguments each time you invoke a command line program. 

**Lin Clark:** Thank you Dan, we will see you all again in 2 weeks
