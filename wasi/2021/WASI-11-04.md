### Poll on Semantic Versioning

**Lin Clark:** Poll is to version APIs separately and use semantic versioning for that. Consensus vote. Anyone object?

I will take that resounding silence as enthusiastic support!

### Walk and talk through some example WASI component scenarios 

**Luke Wagner:** Last time talking about versioning. Helped me see that some of the examples should have versioning. Seemed like versioning info should go in package.json, etc. Syntax is different, but same thing in wasm.

Now cargo.toml doesn’t just have this one thing. Types will be internally visible to Rust. Same with origin and cache. On exporting side, they generate a trait that you implement. With that, we realized that you’re exporting an instance that supports an interface. Capitalization is different, because it gets kebob cased for this ecosystem. 

This is the updated way it looks in the Rust code.

**Ben Titzer:** What is kebob case. 

**Luke Wagner:** Where you have dashes between. It’s what’s used in package management ecosystems commonly.

**Ben Titzer:** Makes sense

**Luke Wagner:** In the wasm, only change is to include the version. This would be the minimally compatible version. Anything in that series before bumping to major should be compatible, so would also be compatible with this component.

Now there’s a nice symmetry between Rust and JS, since JS doesn’t have macros.

Any questions?

Redirect404 Rust Impl [slide]

If I have two backends, have import-as in .toml. Looks the same in wasm as before. We’ve basically wrapped the previous thing in a named instance.

NormalizingCache Rust impl [slide]

Looks the same as normal, non-component dependencies.

**Ben Titzer:** How exact is the versioning here

**Luke Wagner:** Follows the ecosystem rules.

**Piotr Sikora:** Quick question, shouldn’t version be in generated Rust.

**Luke Wagner:** Uses the conventions of the ecosystem.

Would capture the exact information from cargo.toml and put it in the name in wasm. Gets transformed based on the target ecosystem for publishing. Still an open question.

JavaScript looks about the same.

In this version, I’m using two deps. Not syntactically much different than before. Got a static DAG, when I instantiate at runtime, imports instances that might be shared with others. Shows up concretely in importing an instance. I don’t get to force that I import the same instance.

Interesting thing is when I want to lock this down. This is that .lock convention, but doing it in the package. Before I’ve done any locking, don’t know what I get at runtime. I want to run a resolve and spit out a new component.lock.wasm. It will embed precise versions. At runtime, I get an instance that contains the dependencies. In the generated wat, the interfaces are still semver queries, but other components are precise versions that I’ve included. This is using module linking as an executable package lock file.

Any questions?

Module imports could easily have been nested imports

**Bailey Hayes**Have you considered including a sum file?

**Luke Wagner:** Great point—yes, you could imagine integrity= some SHA hash. Then I’m being ultra precise.

[discussion between Lin and Till on semver resolution in npm and cargo around differences between npm and cargo in resolving queries specified with only the first two digits, e.g. 1.3]

Non isomorphic case a little tricky, where do we put it in package.json/cargo.toml. What if we had a linker script?

I’m going to import dependencies, but as private dependencies, they come in as modules that I instantiate privately. 

…

A little like dependency injection that was popular a decade ago. Academics were wondering “Isn’t this just perameterization?” And that’s what we’re doing here.

**Sam Clegg:**These private instances and private deps, that’s just wasm specific, right? 

**Luke Wagner:** Yes, but talking to the JS folks and they see use cases, maybe something using Realms. But at the moment, Wasm specific.

**Sam Clegg:**And the purpose here is to avoid depending on first class instantiations. Trying to do something more declarative?

**Luke Wagner:** Yeah, really want to have this declaratively.

**Sam Clegg:**Yeah, and we don’t have runtime constructs in Wasm yet, so we don’t want to depend on JS.

**Luke Wagner:** And this allows me to optimize and cross-module inline. In this case, I’ve injected JS in between so limits optimizability, but 

**Sam Clegg:**Once we have fully dynamic runtime, I worry that it will just be that.

**Luke Wagner:** Good point, but you know how we do Wizer? Hoping we could potentially snap shot. But, at same time, JS doesn’t look ergonomic in this case. For example, some default stuff is happening with types which makes it hard to use WebAssembly.instantiate.

**Sam Clegg:**Makes sense, thanks

**Luke Wagner:** What if I didn’t want to do hooking or wrapping. Did I need to pull in a whole JS engine to link these up?

Wat is quite verbose for this. What if I could just write this, and then we could have a single tool that generates the wat for us.

CacheyRedirector via (hypothetical) linker script [slide]

**Sam Clegg:**This is link an easy way to write wat files. Could be useful for writing wat in general.

**Luke Wagner:** Now that I think of that, that takes us down a rabbit hole.

**Sam Clegg:**But just doing outer wrapper

**Luke Wagner:** Doing logically the same thing as Docker compose. That’s the point, to specialize on just the composition part. 

Here’s what we ellided. Default propagation of imports.

Any questions?

One kind of fun thng is that this is an executable linker script. I think that’s cool—one thing that we keep using to build bigger and bigger things.

Seventh component [slide]

Eight component [slide]

I want to locally test using mock components. I have filesystem natively, but not backend and cache. I have this component. It runs in a prod host. It’s a single wasm file, with nested components etc. What I’d like to do for my local testing scenario is create instances of the mock backend and cache and then wrap it and scripts my exports. 

Final thoughts

This is not normal function composition, like the Unix pipeline model. This is more like HOC functions plus currying. This is a far more powerful form of composition because it allows recursive control flow. If we want to do any of these HTTP scenarios, I need this more powerful form of composition. ReadThroughCache wouldnt’ work with simpler composition. I think prev component models stopped here, because they didn’t have imports. I think that’s in part what prevented it from working in previous iterations. But some of the research ones did.

**Ben Titzer:** There was a component system from Java called Jiazi(?). I think it was done by Matthew Flat.

**Luke Wagner:** This units model has propagated through lots of things. Talked with him after stack switching group. Was it any good?

**Ben Titzer:** I remember reading the paper when it came out.
