### wasi-threads: request for comments

**Andrew Brown**: We can use wasi-threads if you cobble together PRs. I have a demo, if you’re interested contact me. This has brought up several issues in how we’re doing things with wasi-libc. Especially want to bring up https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/502. This is about switching wasi convention. Currently wasi module is expected to export memory. Think we should import instead. Think it would be best to consider sooner rather than later. If you have an opinion, please take a look.

**Wilson Wang**: what is the relationship between wasi thread and the future in component model?

**Andrew Brown**: Luke, Alex and I wrote up a plan: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4949#issuecomment-1282975456

**Kyle Brown**: Not even a memory being imported/exported at all? Looking forward to preview 2, at that point maybe there isn’t a memory. I think we’re losing that as part of the idea.

**Andrew Brown**: That might make this change easier

**Kyle Brown**: Part of the reason is that component models’ shared nothing means that in general you’re not sharing memory across components

**Sam Clegg**: Don’t they lower to wasm core modules?

**Kyle Brown**: They do lower to core wasm, but the runtime or embedding of CM is connecting the memories. The question, Luke, was originally about importing vs exporting memories in wasi. In the preview 2 future, does the shared nothing boundary means this doesn’t make sense.

**Luke Wagner**: One important distinction is between components and intracomponent. Between components, not shared. Most of the WASI interfaces are at the component level, but for parallelism we’ve talked about having these as core modules inside components. 

**Kyle Brown**: wasi threads needs to be expressed in that lower, core module way then.

**Luke Wagner**: Shared memory parallelism is pretty advanced and needs to be deeply integrated with the host, so this is an advanced use case. We have talked about expanding wit to cover core wasm modules, which would be useful for importing core in other contexts as well. It will be expressable I think, but it’s more of a when. Hard to do now since we’re just bootstraping.

**Sam Clegg**: I think we should support both. 

**Dan Gohman**: Interesting ? for the component model. Do we want to have it use import instead of export. Not that much more work for the engines to create the memory themselves.

**Sam Clegg**: In an ideal world, we wouldn’t be exporting at all. In the future world, that may be the case.

**Dan Gohman**: In core wasm, we don’t have much option.

**Andrew Brown**: I felt it made more sense at a conceptual level because the model is that the engine hands me the memory before me the wasm module start running it. The engine is the one creating the memory regardless.

**Sam Clegg**: It’s also just less code in the JS world if you dont’ need to do new wasm memory whenever you start a module.

**Luke Wagner**: Emscripten evolution

**Sam Clegg**: By default in ems we have moved to module creating and exporting. 

**Luke Wagner**: That’s sort of why active data segments were created.

**Andrew Brown**: If we want to continue the discussion, issue 502 would be a good place. Would like to come to conclusion.

### Wasi-poll and wasi-io refresh

**Dan Gohman**: Quick bit of background: started these at the beginning. Clear that streams would be really important. Seemed like a good design, then realized that they are so fundamental that they should be fully integrated. Moved to component model. 

Then, we started recognizing that streams will take a bit because async is taking a bit more time. So we’re bringing these back for preview 2 timeframe.

### Preview 2 update

**Dan Gohman**: Plan to build preview 1 to preview 2 prototype. Can run preview 1 binaries and run on preview 2 hosts. This will allow us to move onto preview 2 sooner rather than later. Working to build a prototype.

Also in this repo is preview 2 host impl. Programs from hello world to spidermonkey are now running on this. Still some more work to do, but some of the big pieces are done. 

We have our own wit files for prototyping, but submitting upstream to WASI, so keeping things in sync as they evolve.

Another part of this is pseudostreams that are based on resources and a built-in type.

**Sam Clegg**: Does polyfill use binary re-writing

**Dan Gohman**: We have a linker that can fuse together

**Sam Clegg**: So both!

**Ayako Akasaka**: Are you going to use wit-bindgen for generating preview2 headers ? sorry for poor question

**Dan Gohman**: If you look at the releases tab, we have releases include generated bindings.

**Lin Clark**: No additional questions

**Dan Gohman**: Overview of pseudostreams and how they work. A little different from how POSIX does things but polyfill handles that

**Bailey Hayes**: quick clarification: will the complete set of wasi-sockets eventually be added to preview2 or to a later preview?

**Dan Gohman**: Hoping to get it in. TCP sockets are there. UDP sockets are hard, trying to figure out. Also have resolution ABI for name lookups

**Dave Bakker**: Need any help with sockets, just lmk

**Dan Gohman**: Will be reaching out once ready to push back up.

**Marcin Kolny**: What date are you targeting

**Dan Gohman**: No specific date. Think it will be usable in the next month. Not sure how to handle in the spec, do we want to officially bless. If so, could be in the next few moths.

**Hung-Ying Tai**: Will the wasi-sockets become a standalone proposal or be a part of the preview2?

**Dan Gohman**: Preview 2 isn’t an official thing. Wasi-sockets is already a proposal, so we’ll just upstream

**Frank Schaffa**: wondering about support for http3 (if this makes sense!)

**Piotr Sikora**: re http3 - there is really no difference from WASI API point of view between HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3, since they share the same HTTP semantics

**Ivan Font**: Where is the prototype work happening?

**Dan Gohman**: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/preview2-prototyping. We’ll be bringing to the group for stamp

**Luke Wagner**: Could we consider “preview2” as just proposing the world that you showed (that pulled everything together) and thus depending on all the other individual interface proposals?

**Dan Gohman**: Yes, that makes sense. That would be what we publish.

**Sam Clegg**: Is the plan to eventually have wasi-sdk produce them without polyfill eventually.

**Dan Gohman**: We’re making some compromises to get things out sooner rather than later. We’re making some compromises here, so might not make sense to push upstream until we get to preview 3. Not really determined yet. Plan is eventually to update wasi-sdk.

**Sam Clegg**: Yeah, we could leapfrog preview 2

**Dan Gohman**: Yeah, because WASI has been held up for too long on CM, so this is just getting us unblocked. We can do engines sooner, but toolchains are the main question. We can figure that out.

**Sam Clegg**: Would there be any reason for producers to switch to preview 2?

**Dan Gohman**: If you want to use more of the features, like streams API, so you could be more efficient. Might be some reasons producers would want to do that. Once we get into wasi-http, there will be more reasons for people to upgrade. It will be in toolchains interest to start thing. Also logging features not accessible through the polyfill. Some toolcahins might want to opt-in, but won’t be a requirement

### wasi-messaging pull interface; scoping and reducing forward risks on wasi-cloud proposals

**Joe Zhou**: A few months ago, introduced SpiderLightnight. Now called wasi cloud. I presented wasi-keyvalue, Dan presented wasi-messaging and wasi-sql. Steve S wrote draft for wasi-blob-store. Haven’t started runtime config, distributed lock service, grpc and http. We’re going to be focusing on grpc and http in short term. 

Take a look at the PR on the wasi-messaging repo for major change.

We want to move forward in a more effective and efficient way. We’ll be reducing scope. Consensus that future and stream types aren’t going to be in near term, so planning to move. Alternatively, we’ll use pseudofuture and pseudostream.

Assume that the resource type will be landed by end of year. For now, we’ll use pseudo-resource.

We want to ensure that wit files are versioned, validated and documented. Also want to establish with community that breaking changes will occur.

### Any other questions

**Wilson Wang**: Working with ___ community. Trying to run WebAssembly on top of ___. In Python, we can serialize functions.

**Kyle Brown**: In a way, modules are also serializable representations.

**Bailey Hayes**: I think CM will enable this. We would have a component that could represent the runtime. When you want to do remote execution, you could link in a tiny component that is your execution.

**Kyle Brown**: Intending to bring back sql-embedding proposal. Don’t think we ever made it an official proposal. Want to bring that back.

**Joe Zhou**: Do you think of putting that in a wasi-sql proposal. 

**Kyle Brown**: They are actually kind of a distinct problems. It doesn’t overlap significantly IIUC. Doc https://hackmd.io/Q93MXGLYTRSeGw7FVelURg?view
