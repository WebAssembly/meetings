#### Phase Process

Will end at 45 minutes after

**Dan Gohman**: Set the stage for what is happening here. Preview 2 has been progress for a long time at this point. Handles and resources are one of the last really big pieces. We will very soon have the pieces in place to start building things and using them in real settings.
 
Previous presentation we talked about the difference between preview 2 and 3 (async).

What does it mean to be in preview 2 and how do we know when preview 2 is ready to “launch”.

WebAssembly/WASI#549

Brief background, this is the CONTRIBUTING.md. 

In the core CG version of this, this is a separate document. The WASI subgroup has a side-version of the CG process. The core CG has updated their phase process since the last time WASI was copied off. Updating WASI now in the same way CG updated.

Phase 0: someone has an idea. No vote required. Intentionally very easy to achieve. Identify champions and the people responsible for moving the proposal through stages. Decide if things are in scope.

Phase 1: To enter this phase, SG determines if this is in-scope.

Note that this document should be talking about the subgroup (SG) and not the community group (CG).

To enter phase 2, we must establish portability. Champions define the acceptance criteria for Phase 4. Phase 4 is effectively standardization. WASI in particular is looking at things that are not browsers and so it makes sense that its not tied to 2 or more web VMs. 

Additionally it should establish consensus - this is a feature we believe should be standardized.

WIT description is defined to enter phase 2.

Phase 2: Implementations proceed through prototypes.

Phase 3: Feature is expected to be fairly stable at this point. Preview 2 will be proposals that have reached phase 3. Not quite a standard but pretty close to being stable.

At this point in time, Preview 2 is the closest we’ve come to define a standard out of the subgroup. At this point in time we are in this “preview” phase. 

Updating the text to have the same structure as the CG phases.

#### Preview 2 Definition Plan

**Dan Gohman**: WebAssembly/WASI#550

This will become the document that defines what preview 2 is. First thing in this document is the Launch criteria AKA how do we know when this is done? Let’s talk about this instead in how a window is opened.

Preview 2 will be considered launched once preview 2 has two worlds advanced to phase 3.

We will live this window open until we wind down preview 2 for preview 3.

We want to be able to show that we have at least two different worlds. This is important to show that WASI is about more than just POSIX. Are all the engines expected to implement all of the APIs? The vision for worlds is that not all engines will have to implement all of these worlds. Some engines may implement all of the worlds, but they would not be required to.

Side note: the two proposals that are the furthest along are WASI CLI and WASI HTTP Proxy worlds. Those are the furthest along but it’s not specifically defined as being those two. The only requirement is that it’s at least two worlds.

WASI Preview 2 Contents is a table that currently contains no elements. As proposals reach phase 3, then we will add them to the table.

This will be as official as a markdown document in GitHub can be in that it’s not an official standard but a statement of stability.

What does it mean to be part of this list? Reach phase 3, as I talked about in the previous agenda item. It must satisfy its own phase 4 acceptance criteria. Phase 4 in the core CG is effectively standardization. We are holding off on that for now, so we are defining a preview and creating a place to grow and evolve things.

In order to define the contents of Preview 2, it must be voted for inclusion by the WASI Subgroup.

Proposals may be added to WASI Preview 2 at any time until Preview 3.
Any questions?

**Conrad Watt**: It has to be virtualizable using a component. 

**Dan Gohman**: We require that all APIs are defined in WIT. There is a possibility that APIs could be awkward to virtualize, but by requiring things be expressed in WIT then we know that everything can be virtualized. 

**Dan Gohman**: I looked around and I found this unofficial rule that when something is posted we wait a week to vote on these things. We are not going to vote now, but we will vote on this process change next week. 2 weeks from now.

**Pat Hickey**: I put this on the agenda.

**Dan Gohman**: Should we document this 1 week wait before an agenda?

**Conrad Watts**: Up to the subgroup on rules. CG follows one day beforehand for a poll. 

**Deepti**: Just 24 hours before in CG.

 **Pat Hickey**: OK then we can follow this in the future but not change for this vote.


**Conrad Watt**: Your point about WIT IDL can be subtly be virtualized. The question of a side-effects of the virtual machine state.

**Dan Gohman**: Today, most modules define and export a linear memory. In wasi-threads, all of the threads have their own module that imports the linear memory. That is a construct that is not possible to represent in WIT.

**Luke Wagner**: In theory you could have a u32 that the host could modify. That’s not readily virtualizable so we wouldn’t want this API. 

**Pat Hickey**: Modules are a core webassmebly unit. There is no concept of exporting a memory from a component. WIT is the interface definition, then you have to implement it in terms of a component. A WIT IDL doesn’t express anything in terms of a core module. The only thing that exists in a module is the canonical ABI.

**Conrad Watt**:The point is that you would want something expressed in the IDL that would express exchanging memory which you cannot do.

**Andrew Brown**: WIT will not be able to express transferring funcrefs across any interfaces.
**Dan Gohman**: There is no funcref type in WIT. The preview 3 plan with async streams and futures. It looks a lot like a callback system with funcrefs. We can do different kinds of control with futures and streams.

**Andrew Brown**: I was thinking of a way to pass in spawn for threads in a way that a funcref is passed in the Core Wasm Threads proposal.

**Pat Hickey**: We’re jumping the gun on threads. Do we have any non-threads questions? Before moving to the next item.

#### The future of WASI threads proposal

**Marcin Kolny**: What should we do about wasi-threads?

The proposal essentially targets a WASI interface to spawn a new thread. The new instance has a copy of its own copies of globals and tables. The only thing that is shared is the memory. This proposal was started over a year ago. Quite a lot of work was done as part of this proposals. Progress has been made across toolchains. There is a PR to enable wasi-threads in rust std. We have places with support in wasmtime, WAMR, and others. 

There is another proposal for having threads as a core wasm feature. I think the wasi-threads proposal will be replaced by the core proposal. 

It may be worth discussing if we need to make any changes before freezing the proposal. 

We perhaps could somehow backport it to WASI Preview 1. There are some complications already discussed in this meeting. 

Technically the only reasonable way to do this is to backport it to wasi Preview 1. It’s already public and part of the toolchains. Part of wasi-libc but not formally part of preview 1.

We should have information and recommendations for how to move to the new Wasm Threads proposal. 

We risk fragmentation of the community if we completely abandon wasi-threads. I am not completely convinced that we should totally wasi-threads.

We should acknowledge that it is already in use and many people already rely on it.

In my case, we ship products in which the runtime can not readily be updated. We need to ensure that the binaries that run on top of that runtime will be able to run on it. We need to find a way to use the latest toolchain and still be able to run older hosts that support wasi-threads. First of all, I really want to know everyone’s opinion on that. On not moving the proposal further. 
In the future, if there are binaries that support this new core proposal, there might be a way to rewrite those binaries in terms of wasi-threads.

One option: maintain the toolchain so that it can work in two modes. One for wasi-threads and one for the new core threads.

Concerns: Not concerned about resourcing because my org will be able to fund this effort. The primary concern is that no one here can guarantee that we won’t want this legacy path.

We will not be able to fork LLVM and provide patches if it is decided in the future to no longer support this path.

Second option: In the binary translated path, we can replace some instructions and magic on the binary to make it compatible with wasi-threads. The primary concern here is that it’s not possible. After brainstorming, we pretty sure this path will work, but no one can guarantee that.

There will always be a risk. 

**Conrad Watt**: One thing that the new proposal will not give you is that the new proposal will not give you at runtime spawn.

**Luke Wagner**: The idea is that you would rewrite if you see a global then use a library. 

**Marcin**: Complex to implement that. But do not know if we can do that for the next 5-6 years.

**Pat Hickey**: We should keep some compatibility within wasi-libc for some amount of time but it is difficult to say how long that will be until this future proposal takes shape. It seems that it should be possible to keep this implementation working. If your team is able to keep this branch alive while newer things move forward and meet that significant amount of effort to bring them forward. 

**Pat Hickey**: These are implementations that live under the WebAssembly org that are implementations and standards. Historically there are implementations like binaryen and others that have always been in WebAssembly. Being in the WebAssembly org, wasi-libc it is in a somewhat strange commons place. We need to err on the side of keeping these implementations in until whatever replaces it is sufficiently stable. That could be time for implementing option 1 or 2. 

**Marcin**: I think that makes sense. One of the concerns that I have is that is it only in wasi-libc or in LLVM or other projects like LLVM where this could happen in other projects.

**Dan Gohman**: LLVM doesn’t know about the spawn side of this. It seems like LLVM should be relatively safe here but I can’t give guarantees. LLVM would need to know about thread local storage. 
**Sam**: I hope we can tell LLVM which ABI to use. There is no reason to have it live in global memory and use something like stack pointer. Move in a direction. This new proposal is no where near phase 4. I imagine wasi-sdk will need wasi-thread path for at least 1 year.

**Marcin**: I need wasi-threads path around for 5-6 years. It looks like there are some ways. We can progress with the toolchains supporting both options. If that gets deleted then we can look for a binary rewrite. 



**Deepti**: Minor clarifying question around what Pat had said in the WebAssembly org versus the Bytecode Alliance org. If you want to respond to the concrete threading we can go ahead with that.

**Pat**: In the Bytecode Alliance, we designate maintainers and have a governance process. Do we have to put it to a vote for these contentious maintenance concerns since this is managed by the subgroup?

**Deepti**: That answers that.

**Luke Wagner**: Security disclosure process is another concern. 

**Pat Hickey**: Right, that was the original concern. When someone reported a security vuln we didn’t have a process within the WebAssembly org to handle that. 

**Conrad Watt**: This is a concern that will continue to come up in non-web embeddings. It is really common to have a MVP version of that proposal is that it is off-loaded to the host in some way. Currently we have a problem that wasi-threads has a way to create a thread in the host. In the future we think we will have native stack switch support in Wasm. Initially you are relying on some kind of web support. The general philosophy has been in non-web to wait for the Core Spec. I can understand why wasi-threads doesn’t fit around the WIT IDL clarifications for virtualization. What is the story for having that work in WASI? Do we decide that we are just not going to add support until the core spec has this support?

Here we are talking about host functions that are about somehow manipulating some part of the Wasm virtual machine. This is the general question for WASI, do we wait for core?

**Luke Wagner**: In WASI we have this concept of builtins. Initially the two builtins were lift and lower. This is where you specify the ABI details like utf-8. If we liked wasi-threads, then we could add a canon thread new. If we liked the core proposal, then we can sort of jam it in as a builtin. This is a third option compared to add it as a host function or wait for the core spec. 

Preferable to have a core instruction, but a builtin is an answer. 

**Conrad Watt**: While it might not be the ideal semantics, it is the incumbent. 

**Luke Wagner**: How do we handle concurrent components. 

**Conrad Watt**: Is it about cross-component?

**Luke Wagner**: Builtins are core to the component. Internal to the component. For core computational things like stacks, threads, grow, etc then builtins are the right place. 

**Conrad Watt**: Are builtins forever?

**Luke Wagner**: Are wasi-threads the semantics we want to keep around forever? I think if we blessed it, it would be exponentially more pain.

**Luke Wagner**: If we think about what we want, we don’t duplicate a function table.

**Conrad Watt**: I think a lot of this is going to still be done because this is how it already is implemented in JavaScript side.

**Luke Wagner**: Even the toolchains aren’t doing this quite yet. It’s really the instance per thread that is the problem.

**Andrew Brown**: What does it mean to freeze wasi-threads? I think we should discuss the stability of wasi-threads; currently it has an experimental ABI with large warnings in all the various repositories that this ABI could change in the future. If Marcin and co. start using wasi-threads, that ABI will become de facto "frozen"--should we fix any of the problems Marcin listed before this "freeze"?

**Pat Hickey**: We are at time so need to end the call. Please use the wasi-threads github.
