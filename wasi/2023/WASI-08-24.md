##### Status update on wasi-clocks timezone update

**Colin Murphy**: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks/pull/48/files

Picked up host side implementation within Wasmtime to add timezone of wasi-clocks.
Timezone is currently written as a resource and not as a per-instance call. If you ask for now, like the system time, we don’t have a file handle for that or http-request. Timezone was originally written to be a resource, all of the clocks really. Changed to be an instance call. 

The tricky part is that on the implementation side it does bring in dependencies, iana_timezone, chrono and chrono_tz. 

**Dan Gohman**: It would be a valid implementation to always say you are in the UTC timezone. If you want to adequately represent the time for humans, then you would be interested in an implementation like what Colin added to wasmtime.

##### Vote: Advance wasi-cli proposal to phase 2

https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-cli

**Pat Hickey**: Dan Gohman would you like to talk about wasi-cli.

**Dan Gohman**: What we need to advance to phase 2, we need to define the portability requirements for phase 4. For WASI CLI, we will have the same requirements as the rest of the proposals. Those proposals support windows, linux, macos operating systems. There should be two implementations.  Those are the requirements that we will have to meet to advance to phase 4, but here we must define that is the advancement criteria to vote on phase 2.

**Pat Hickey**: Environment variables, ability to exist, and everything involving std-io. Ability to call is-a-tty on streams. All of these are interfaces within this CLI package definition.

**Bailey Hayes**: At one point this was called wasi-cli-core, right?

**Pat Hickey**: Well yes, in wasmtime. That was really because we didn’t have the expressiveness in WIT to define what we wanted.

**Dan Gohman**: Never something within this subgroup, only wasmtime.

**Pat Hickey**: Unanimous consent vote. Any objections to this passing?

**Pat Hickey**: OK the vote has passed with unanimous consent.


##### Changes to streams

[wasi-io#38](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-io/pull/38)

**Pat Hickey**: Last meeting I talked about changes to streams. One of the discussion points that was brought up in this meeting that was super appreciated, we talked about back-pressure. We’ve also been talking about flushing. The wasmtime users have been using this proposed version of streams. We really need flush to determine when the stream has completed. You need to be able to write something, let the event loop go off and do something else, then also know when the stream has completed. A host implementation might be able to do some magic to allow for buffered output to stdout after your Wasm program has stopped or trapped. But the case we need flushing for is, what if your implementation of stdout is not the host but another component. That component will no longer be able to execute after another component in the system has trapped. So if the stdout implementation component has a buffer that should be flushed before that trap, the caller needs to explicitly communicate that intent to flush, and give the stdout component time to e.g. write a buffered line off to some log service in a cloud context. 

There is a wasmtime PR right now that is a work-in-progress for an implementation of flush. We resisted adding flush to output stream for a while, because we didn’t want to add it unless absolutely necessary, but we have not come up with another way to solve this problem other than with the method that I just described.

**Pat Hickey**: The other aspect we have changed is backpressure. When you write to an output stream you are sending a list<bytes> to another component, consuming their memory. They may not have enough memory to handle a really big write, so we need some way to communicate a bound on how much of another programs resources the caller consumes. We can’t let you consume an unbounded amount of resources. There is a new scheme that the user of an output stream calls a function to check how much its allowed to write, then the callee (implementation) can respond it can accept so much input, including none at all. We had the ability to for the implementation to not accept more input before by returning 0 length consumed, but the difference now is that we are doing this before we incur a copy of the bytes into the implementing component. If the implementation can only consume a small chunk at a time of a large write, this scheme avoids paying for the large copy over and over.

**Pat Hickey**: I was hoping the current streams PR would be the last one for Preview 2, but that’s not the case. There is at least one more for flush.
