##### Presentation on wasi-sockets by Dave Bakker

**Dave Bakker:** README On github out of date, please don’t look there. Will update it soon. Client and server. No ambient authority on all platforms. POSIX compatible layer should be built on top. Component model is not POSIX compatible so, need that layering.

Non-goals, to clarify. Low level TCP and UDP sockets. Have had some issues openned over time for higher level support of stuff. That’s not really in scope. Really should enable network access. HTTPS not in scope, retrieving other network info like installed network interfaces, etc. 

I thought I’d start with how a TCP client would look from the consumer side. Client, from client perspective, you get network handle which is mostly just an opaque resource that reps some kind of network access. In raw POSIX impl, there is no general file descriptor from which you can derive more specific resources. No root handle in POSIX (e.g. like filesystem dir), so I invented it. The idea is that there’s one default network specified. In future, a component may get passed down multiple network handles. Ex: one that can only access database, or one that can only access a specific domain… any kind of firewalling.

This function, called instance network, is IIRC a temporary function. It’s there just as a placeholder for value imports at component model level. At moment, just one method which … the network. In future, might be multiple networks with own slice. Network is mostly virtual. Does not need to map to physical network interfaces. 

**Chris Woods:** Is it meant to rep a network interface?

**Dave Bakker:** it may

**Chris Woods:** Physical or virtual, it’s a network interface? 

**Dave Bakker:** At this moment there’s just one, but maybe in the future maybe component can declare multiple requirements

**Chris Woods:** So in future thinking there might be a negotiation?

**Dave Bakker:** Might be, they don't’ have to be declared statically.

**Chris Woods:** For now, I have my network handle, what happens next?

**Dave Bakker:** Now we move on. Next on the client. Resolve the domain name of party connecting to. This iss provided by the IP lookup interface. This interface provides domain name lookup, not just specific to DNS. Rather than returning a list sync, the resolve addresses func returns an async stream which can be iterated on. Goal is for it to be a proper CM stream so these methods (resolve-next-address, drop-resolve-address-stream) wouldn’t be necessary anymore. But for now, I’ve stubbed it out to a manual impl of what CM will provide. So we request domain lookup, iterates over each result, then drop these resolve stream. At this moment, the addresses will contain all the results of resolve stream. For brevity, assumed this will all be magically ready without await, but could subscribe to async events using wasi-poll. 

Next step: set up actual socket. Creating socket without capability handle… this means that when creating a socket initially, this socket is just an in-mem config object. This was done to increase POSIX compat. At moment of creating a socket, no need for POSIX compat layer to know which network to bind to. So you create a socket, in this case IPv6, and options inc set-keep-alive. Create a socket, you can configure any way you want. Up til this moment, the network handle hasn’t been necessary yet… up to the moment where we actually want to use the network. Then need to bind to a specific network. In initial version, only 1 network handle which the libc can use as the default, but in a world where there are multiple, libc might iterate and figure out which is most appropriate network handle. Might be from address it’s going to connect to, IP address range, etc.

Connect method is async, so we can await in the future. Connect method returns send and receive stream from wasi-io-streams proposal. Another diff from BSD, where socket desc is both input and output stream. Assuming the connection succeeds, we send some data using streams proposal. A TCP socket can be shut down, preferably shut down is implicit when ending send and receive stream. Since they aren’t really available yet, for now manually call the methods. So we write some data for the server we shut down for sending, then we read, then we shut down read. Then drop all of our resources. 

Any questions?

**Jamey Sharp:** Do you have a UDP example as well?

**Dave Bakker:** If you want I can go over the specs.

**Jamey Sharp:** Curious, but don’t want to interrupt.

**Dave Bakker:** Don’t have an example from usage perspective, but will be similar. Main difference that UDP connect doesn’t return streams that can be written to.

**Chris Woods:** I have a more approach question. When we look at WASI in general, we can define interfaces for things like HTTPS, etc. Defining a socket level WASI interface. For me, the main reason is to support legacy software. Then having POSIX support becomes pretty important. I know there’s plan for compat layer. Is this a case of here’s a list of POSIX functions we need to support, because I’m looking at what’s the value in the proposal. What’s your vision on that approach… just looking at the delta?

**Dave Bakker:** Expect that applications running in WASI will mostly interact with streams. Everything else is for providing POSIX compat. 

**Chris Woods:** …

**Dave Bakker:** The way I view, proposal is a blend between POSIX compat using component model primitives. So the fact that the socket doesn’t have a send method itself, that is to use the component model primitive to best advantage. 

**Chris Woods:** So as part of the proposal output, you’re going to do a GAP analysis? Is that part of the proposal?

**Dave Bakker:** Not at this moment. It hasn’t been written down, but 80% of the POSIX spec is implementable with this proposal. Weeds of socket options becomes a portability problem. So we can’t guarantee that every option will be provided. But the main stuff: sendto, send message, peer name, all the basic stuff should be implmentable. 

**Chris Woods:** And on the change between get ops and set ops bit. What’s advantage of calling them out in individual functions?

**Dave Bakker:** They aren’t actually ints in each case, and that’s not really implmentable in wit.

**Dan Gohman:** I would also characterize it as a virtualization limitation. If you have intermediaries, it’s good to have type for forwarding. 

**Chris Woods:** Yeah, I get it. We need to think about API design, why would you do that in POSIX, you don’t know what values you have in advance. Able to make a change without an interface change, so don’t need to update WASI standard.

**Dan Gohman:** Useful to point out that that would be a new WASI standard. There’s no shortcut around that.

**Kyle Brown:** We do have a flags type in wit, for things that have something on or off. Instead of passing int, could be flag type. Subtype related upgrading. 

**Chris Woods:** That makes sense. I’m thinking about practicality of supporting legacy code. Thinking out loud, so I could be wrong. 

**Dan Gohman:** You’d call to libc which would have POSIX interface, so you’d get ENOSYS etc. 

**Chris Woods:** Or you’d get an error.

**Dan Gohman:** You as the programmer wouldn’t get that because libc would handle for you 

**Dave Bakker:** Also not all options are bools. Then you’d have to defer to having massive variant.

**Chris Woods:** So libc is going to be repackaging the message. Ok, thanks for doing the dive on that.

**Dave Bakker:** Any other questions?

**Jamey Sharp:** UDP, I assume you don't’ want sendto where you can have message and recipient in one call. 

**Dave Bakker:** OK to park that question?

**Jamey Sharp:** Sure

**Dave Bakker:** Let me go through server. Network handle that can instantiate TCP listeners. Set some network options. Set the backlog of the listen queue or accept queue. Has been split into socket option, so split what is effectively a duality of the native listen call. On some platforms, transitions to listen state and sets backlog state. So that has been split out in WASI side into backlog size option and the listen method. The socket option is updatable over time. 

**Dan Gohman:** Should point out that listen once is a portability thing.

**Dave Bakker:** Right, updating listen backlog not supported on all platforms. 

**Dan Gohman:** Want to make sure that distinguish between CM constraints and portability constraints.

**Dave Bakker:** So socket is set up, time to bind to local address on specific network. Deferred until last possible moment, bind method. Then we transition to a listener state. Then accept new client sockets, which is async. Accept returns output and input stream. 

Questions?

**Dan Gohman:** Requirement around significant runtimes? Maybe should add some of those as acceptance criteria. That would largely cover POSIX compat. Would that make sense?

**Chris Woods:** That would make perfect sense. 

**Lin Clark:** May want to have a limit to significant runtimes.

**Dan Gohman:** Subtlety that we say POSIX, but we dont’ really mean that because POSIX means so many different things. Rust probably makes sense.

**Lin Clark:** Python seems like another good option. 

**Joel Dice:** uses wasi-libc

**Dan Gohman:** That’s fine, as long as we support the portable set of functionality in Python, that’s enough o show that it’s doing what it’s supposed to do.

**Dave Bakker:** I’ve done an inventory. Very quick to see what are generally supported.

**Dan Gohman:** That’s awesome, thanks for doing this. 

#### Vote: Advance wasi-sockets to phase 2

Decision to postpone until acceptance criteria is modified to reflect the requirement around significant runtimes.

#### Discussion: Where should wasi-cloud-core implementations live? by @danbugs

**Dan Chiarlone:** Shared a document in the chat. Big point is to discuss where wasi-cloud-core impls should live. Different from impls that make sense to be in runtime. For cloud-core, might be cloud specific. Want to avoid duplicating code. 

**Lin Clark:** Does charter allow for this?

**Dan Gohman:** If it’s a virtualization, then the CG should own it. But for other impls, probably not a WASI concern

**Luke Wagner:** That makes sense to me too.

**Dan Gohman:** Yeah, wasi’s not a great place for maintaining software, so I think these would live outside. We may impl these on top of wasi-sockets, 

**Kyle Brown:** At that point, less of a question of wasi.

**Dan Chiarlone:** Ok, will bring up in another venue.
