    1. Prototyping resources using psuedo-handles
        - As a way to phase in the implementation of resources and handles,
          and enable guest-language developer-facing experimentation, I'm
          proposing a `resource` and handle syntax that uses pseudo-handles
          in the implementation. See here for more details:

#### seudo-handles for resources

**Dan Gohman**: Resources are a feature we are looking to have in the component model and WIT syntax, and we are looking for ways to unblock the frontend side of the story.
This proposal is a way to generate the guest-side/language-side bindings.
This is an implementation we can complete sooner rather than later.

Using wasi-io as an example, the `input-stream` is a pseudo-resource handle implementation.
A way to pass in a virtual stream as an index into a table.

This is a low-tech implementation. If handles are u32 values and then enable this syntax in WIT files. In the guest-side bindings, we could now get `stream.read`. It would also mean if we have the resource syntax, we could have the bindings that we could call, e.g. `stream.drop-input` could be called automatically vs the current requirement of calling this manually.

When we have real handles, we could then switch them out on the host side.

**Bailey Hayes**: What are the downsides to this approach?

**Dan Gohman**: There are a few downsides such as

- There is still a global table that lives in the store. Because we have a global table we won't have  shared-nothing isolation, aka no isolation between components.
- No way to prevent use-after-free on resources and will require developers to be careful.

But these are things we can work on the backend and allows us to do this work in parallel.

We can begin talking about and demonstrating with resources with this implementation.
This will make it easier for us to rollout the end-user story for resources and will unblock a significant chunk of work.

**Luke Wagner**: Do you anticipate guest languages will have to change if we move from pseudo-handles to proper handles?

**Dan Gohman**: I do not think so.

**Dave Bakker**: Do you forsee a semantic change?

**Dan Gohman**: Yes, the per-component table will change. This will change and will be observable.

**Timmy Silesmo**: I started implementing the resource syntax. I want to change it to add reference counting. We can currently parse to the AST. Next will be lowering and lifting of handles.

**Dan Gohman**: These resources will do reference counting. The future plan is to add owned and borrowed handles. This will be a subset of the plan. Reference counting is the general solution but will have a small performance impact. Over time we will add additional resource handle types.

**Kyle Brown**: For forgeability, how hard would it be to put in a limited version of an approach like pointer-authentication so that pseudo handles are created with some of their high-order bits set in some random way and if you try to use a handle with an invalid bit pattern you trap?

**Timmy Silesmo**: We had a discussion right before this meeting. We had an idea for how this could be implemented but may not be in the first implementation.

**Dan Gohman**: Yes, we want to make sure we have the option to do this. Important to get something working now even if it has downsides like use-after-free.

**Luke Wagner**: One good thing is that for safe languages, e.g. JavaScript, the bindings will handle this. JS shouldn’t be able to hit this vs today’s u32 could hit this. Only for unsafe languages like C.

**Kyle Brown**: What does this look like for something that has a destructor?

**Luke Wagner**: For guest JS, the entire engine is being compiled and has a finalization hook that is built-in to the object.

**Kyle Brown**: So it will need to make types that calls finalizing.

**Luke Wagner**:  Right, we will need to do this in either solution. This will unblock that work so that we can get started now.

**Kyle Brown**: On reference counting, are we going to be able to prevent cycles?

**Luke Wagner**: Inside a guest, you can always any inter-component cycles since these will be black boxes. But for intra-component, component imports are acyclic so the component imports protect us from this.

**Kyle Brown**: Resources can’t be passed up or down in a diamond.

**Dan Gohman**: Resources can be defined by the host. Hosts will need to be careful about not defining cycles.

**Luke Wagner**: Callbacks in the JS heap. Callback will contain closure state and would create cycles. This is why we solved this in WIT to prevent a callback-y style way of handling resources.

**Pat Hickey**: Reminder to please send agenda items into the repo. Thank you for coming and see you in two weeks!
