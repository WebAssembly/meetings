#### Vote: Advance wasi-http proposal to Phase 2

**Pat Hickey:** We are essentially voting on the compatibility criteria of wasi-http proposal

**Pat Hickey:** https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-http#phase-4-advancement-criteria

**Pat Hickey:** Luke now one of the champions of wasi-http. He has been very involved since day zero. He has added the set of compatibility criteria. Must have two complete independent implementations. One of the rules of the implementations is that it must execute in the browser using fetch. This means wasi-http will work both in the web and on the server. Traditionally everyone working on wasi-http has been working on the non-browser implementations first. We are making wasi-http working in the browser a requirement.

**Pat Hickey:** The Fetch API is the way you do modern http requests. The Fetch API does not implement trailers today. We will have to cover this in the spec to cover this implementation detail. Does anyone have anything to add?

**Pat Hickey:** Any questions or concerns?

**Petr Penzin**: I like that this is required to be compatible with the Web API. How does it compare to the Web version, though?

**Luke Wagner**: We looked at fetch while we were working on this. This is based on a spec worked on by Mark Knottingham that both are built on. Fetch has very restrictive headers that we may have more work on fine details.

**Petr Penzin**: I’m not an expert so when you say it doesn’t support trailers, I’m not sure what that means.

**Luke Wagner**: This is a newer feature.

**Till**: Most of the stuff specified in the WHATWG spec, I implemented at Fastly’s Compute@Edge a couple of years ago. One of the goals of the wasi-http spec is to be compatible with this. Over the last few days, I have started working on this within JavaScript side and have not seen any major users. I expect this to pass the WPT platform web test suite. I don’t see any issues there and feel very optimistic about it.

**Petr Penzin**: Nice, thank you.

**SBC**: A lot of the other WASI API’s do not try to mirror web-y things. Do you think this is going to be a requirement to mirror the web everywhere? Why bother to mention browsers?

**Luke Wagner**: People are already polyfilling components into browsers. The goal is to be able to run components in lots of places and Service Workers.

**SBC**: Will all WASI API’s mirror web API’s.

**Luke Wagner**: Not in a blank check sense. OPFS, it would be cool to implement wasi-fs on OPFS via polyfill.

**Till**: more accurate to say fetch spec is implemented in terms of the http spec as is the wasi-http spec. The fetch implementation I just mentioned is non-trivial. It has a lot of code in it to implement the fetch spec in terms of another API. It is not an identical API but serves roughly the same function.

**Petr Penzin**: OPFS, when not in the browser but running in JS engines, then you have similar API’s but not exactly the same. The goal of compiling C++, Rust, what have you, then these API’s will not exactly match the JS APIs. It makes sense that there is a balance here.

**Piotr Sikora**: Will this be phase criteria for all WASI proposals or specific to HTTP? 

**Pat Hickey:** No, specific to wasi-http. We think this is appropriate for wasi-http since fetch API exists and so it makes it desirable. Sockets for instance, there will never be a requirement for it to work on the web, there will never be a way to make it work on the web. 

**Piotr Sikora**: What about WebTransport and/or WebSockets?

**Pat Hickey:** Exposing web transport would be very interesting.

**Piotr Sikora**: It could also lead to partitioning of the WASI worlds. We want to create the HTTP proxy world and that requirement may conflict with the needs of browsers. 

**Pat Hickey**:  We expect that the http-proxy world is the thing that will work in browsers. Sockets is very intentionally not part of this world. One world we’ve tossed around conversationally is a caching http proxy store. When in a serverless environment, you could have more sharing of that cache.

**Till**: @Piotr Sikora part of the stage 2 entrance criteria is defining stage 4 criteria, so it's not purely up to the proposal champions. Instead, the WASI SG has to assess the validity of those criteria in deciding whether the proposal should advance to stage 2

**Petr Penzin**: If there was a requirement to consider Web mapping, it would be easier to see which parts of the web are mappable and which are not. Though that might not make sense for some proposals. 

**Pat Hickey:** Let’s make the things that are mappable, mappable. And for the things that are not that’s OK. This is part of the virtualization story that enables you to run somewhere where it is not natively available.

**Petr Penzin**: There is no phase 4 in the WASI process yet. Let’s clarify that.

**Pat Hickey:** Prior to the last vote we changed the name of these criteria from “phase 4 criteria” to “compatibility criteria”. That name change hasn’t bubbled through everywhere yet. We need to meet those criteria in order to ship Preview 2 or at least show that this is on a very good path to being met. We are voting on what those criteria are, today.

**Colin Murphy**: Dumb user question. We have tokio, one day we will have rustls. 

**Pat Hickey**: I want to see all of these common tools in the Rust ecosystem work on top of WASI Preview 2. 

**Colin Murphy**: Goal to reach people with tiny web app.

**Pat Hickey**: Realistically this is going to be one of those things that takes time to percolate through the ecosystem. It isn’t a gate to saying the standard is done. The standard needs to be stable before that percolation can happen.

**Sam**: Even if we don’t go to components, we can use some of the same core API’s. This is a general discussion that emscripten may be able to start targeting some of the same API’s. 

**Pat Hickey**: OK let’s do a vote. We are going to do this by unanimous consent. If you want to dissent, you can do this now by speaking up or by posting a message in the chat.

**Pat Hickey**: Thank you everyone. Now wasi-http is phase 2.

#### Plan for reaching Preview 2 by 11/30/2023 meeting

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-P49kDej_5Vir8HyOcMcL9aES6nf_KUlzSTZWnTo_-U/edit?usp=sharing


**Pat Hickey:** Our goal here over the next couple of months is to ship preview 2. This is my and consensus shared with a lot of this group already for how we are going to do that.

**Pat Hickey:** Last meeting we ratified all of the shipping criteria.

**Pat Hickey:** Two proposals with worlds including their dependencies. Must have a credible plan for satisfying portability criteria. Like everything here, we vote that we all agree that it is satisfied.

**Pat Hickey:** wasi-http proxy is one of those worlds. wasi-cli command is the other. If you aren’t already familiar with wasi-cli, then it is similar to posix-y things. Isatty and ability to get your arguments and environment variables. Things that many programs need to do. 

**Pat Hickey:** wasi:filesystem is not an import of wasi-http proxy world.

**Pat Hickey:** Summarizing the portability criteria of all of these, the criteria is that there are two independent implementations that works across linux, mac, and windows. HTTP outbound uses whatwg Fetch.

**Pat Hickey:** wasi-io and wasi-poll that are two closely related things. We decided to merge these. [wasi-io#46](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-io/pull/46). All of the reasonably complicated proposals depend on streams. Fundamentals are all the same but now same namespace. 

**Pat Hickey:** Wasmtime and JCO transpile are the leading implementations.

**Pat Hickey:** Green check means as done as it can be. We’re still adopting full resources so more changes may come. “Essentially done, basically working”

**Pat Hickey:** wasi:sockets and wasi:http are undergoing significant work.

**Pat Hickey:** Status for JCO is similar to wasmtime but a little behind. That’s OK. One of the tricks with JCO is that it has to integrate with the web event loop. There are things that we can do easily in wasmtime and that you cannot do very easily in the web. Specifically poll-list (previously poll-oneoff) which work is undergoing.

**Pat Hickey:** For wasi-sockets, it’s important that JCO transpile can support sockets in Node.js since there are no sockets available in the web.

**Pat Hickey:** I welcome deep conversation on any one of these items for how we will meet any of these requirements.

**Pat Hickey:** [Bytecode Alliance’s Ship WASI Preview 2 GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/10/views/1). Broken down into all the little things that we are going to work on to get this done over the next couple of months.

**Pat Hickey:** Let’s do one big vote. We can do this all grouped as one vote as long everyone is onboard for doing it all at once. Let’s talk about it in the future as this gets closer. 

**Pat Hickey:** Stretch goal Nov 30, Dec 14 is the last regular meeting of the year. This is our goal right now.

**Pat Hickey:** Speak up at any time if you see any concerns. We prefer unanimous consent. If you think something isn’t worthy of Preview 2, bring it up.

**Pat Hickey:** Dan Gohman has been doing a phenomenal job bringing forward resources. Many others contributed to the tooling as well. Thank you everyone who has also been contributing to the resources tooling.

**Pat Hickey:** Implementations are ongoing but we are no longer seeing major changes. Mostly smaller details that are being fleshed out in several proposals. Please be involved and understanding how this will impact you and your platform. The early we can talk about that, the better it is for everyone.

**Pat Hickey:** Preview 2 is not our end goal. It is our ticket to keep working on this. We have to ship preview to be in the hands of our customers and be stable code that we can start building on it.

**Petr Penzin**: Two concerns. The vote from unanimous consent is a different from what the CG does, where lack of interest can also preclude a proposal from advancing. Moving multiple proposals at once by consent is even more so. 

**Pat Hickey:** Vote early and often advice should help cover this.

**Luke Wagner**: We have to be individually happy with each of these proposals to phase 3, then we will vote on a snapshot of the collection of these.

**Bailey Hayes**: (chat) Several recent Wasm CG groups votes have been unanimous consent.

**Piotr Sikora**: The goal stated in the slides was to vote everything at once to phase 3. 

**Pat Hickey:** That was my goal. We can phase 3 vote ahead of time if necessary. It’s a lot of procedural votes and was hoping to reduce that. The proposals are very interrelated. Many of these like streams impact http and files. Many of the lower-level proposals were influenced by learning from the implementation.

**Petr Penzin**: In CG proposal champions make the case to the group to move it forward, here we are going to get a very different dynamic, when WASI Subgroup would itself move all proposals at once, unless there are objections.

**Petr Penzin**: I actually have another question. You are using wasmtime and JCO transpile. One objection to this is that JCO is not really a runtime. JCO is a compatibility layer. Implementing something like that is different from having two different WebAssembly engines.

**Pat Hickey:** The goal of a component runtime is to be able to run a component. Being able to run in a browser engine and in wasmtime means we were able to ship without needing native support. If the goal is only to be able to run it, then if we can run it. 

**Petr Penzin**: wasm2c is not considered an engine.

**Pat Hickey:** wasm2c is not a Web engine. The core wasm cg has a requirement for two Web engines, but the WASI subgroup does not use that requirement because we are concerned with use cases beyond just the Web.

**Petr Penzin**: If you have two transpilers, then you could move it forward right?

**Pat Hickey:** Yes

**Luke Wagner**: If it is part of the portability requirements for the proposal as in those are the goals where that proposals needs to run, then yes.

**Piotr Sikora**: Concern of underspecified specification since both "independent" implementations (JCO and Wasmtime) are primarily developed by Fastly.

**Till Schneiderit**: Wasmtime has major contributions from 4 different companies. JCO will largely be implemented by Fastly and Fermyon. In total we have 4 different companies involved in the different implementations. If it were the same people on the same team, then I would agree it would not be enough.
