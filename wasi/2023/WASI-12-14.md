### Notes


### Discussion, Q&A: WASI Preview 2 vote on 1/11/2024

Pat Hickey: WASI Preview 2 criteria we are working on the second reference implementation in JCO.

Guy Bedford: JCO serve basic implementation. Random, io, clocks still at 100%, cli at 100%, fs from 82% to 93%, http outgoing was completed, http incoming now running two out of the three test integrations, 88/99 tests passing. The last bit can also be the hardest so don’t rule out any surprises. We’re expecting to be very close to a conformant implementation next month. There’s still a little bit to go for the fs edge cases and socket work. We’re about 12 test cases away.

Pat Hickey: A proposal must reach phase 3, which we voted on last meeting. 

Pat Hickey: We are expecting the second reference implementation to be complete by the next WASI meeting, January 11th.
