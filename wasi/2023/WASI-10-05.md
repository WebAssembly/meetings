#### Updates on implementations

**Bailey Hayes**: <https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/10/views/1>
Wit syntax iterations. Semicolons will be required.
Alex has proposed a gradual roll out, to mitigate the disruption.
<https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223391-wasm/topic/WIT.20and.20semicolons>
<https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/1212>

##### Resources

**Dan Gohman**: Resources and Handles
Resources: represent arbitrary external objects
Handles: References to Resources.
Owned Handles and Borrowed Handles, similar to Rust but done at runtime.
Handles are like file descriptors, but different in a few key ways. Handles are typed and have a set of methods. The IDL declares what things are owned and what things are borrowed.
HTTP, Sockets (including UDP), have been changed to use resources and handles.

#### Vote: Advance wasi-cli to phase 2

**Bailey Hayes** Approval signifies that the portability criteria have been defined.
**Dan Gohman** This pulls in things that are not already defined, such as CLI worlds.
**Chris Woods** So, we voted to use WIT in its pre-semi-colon state. Now we are changing WIT ? - Am I getting that right ?
**Chris Woods** Changing the WIT spec prior to preview2 seems to detract from stability
**Bailey Hayes** Open issues for component model that are potentially incoming:
- <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/256>
- <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/253>
- <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/238>
**Bailey Hayes** We don’t want to change the syntax after preview 2.

**SBC** Handles are i32. Are they forgeable?
**Dan Gohman** Handles are unforgeable, since they have no meaning outside of their module context.

**Bailey Hayes** Consensus vote
**Bailey Hayes** Vote passes

#### WASI-NN Subgroup

**Andrew Brown** We started a WebAssembly ML working group. Aimed at advancing the WASI-NN spec and implementations to where it needs to be. Lots of companies are interested in using WASI-NN, but they need changes.

<https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-ml-meetings/blob/main/2023/ML-10-03.md>

WASI-NN world will need to be modified as well. That falls to this subgroup.

**Bailey Hayes** Meeting notes should be moved to bytecode alliance meetings repo
