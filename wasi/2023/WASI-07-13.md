#### wasi:keyvalue/cache interface

Joe: This is a new cacheing interface in the keyvalue proposal. There are a lot of similarities between cacheing and storage, and cacheing is very important to applications. Cacheing is not persisted. The cache interface is very similar in terms of access pattern and datastructures. Typically a distributed cache has TTL Time To Live support, for eviction. Uncommon for a keyvalue to have eviction. Should persistent keyvalue and cacheing be the same interface, or different? Luke and I have come up with the new cacheing interface

Luke: Some of the signatures look slightly different from persistent keyvalue. This is a different interface, but its part of the same package as key value because it is related. We are covering a lot of cache use cases but not every single advanced use case. In the browser there is a Web Cache that takes into account all of the HTTP semantics - that is a separate thing, this is just a simple key-value cache.

Luke: [describing the wit interface file on github] The interface uses pollable for async. We reuse the common key-value types for key, incoming and outgoing values. Here is future-get-result, returns an option which is some when it is ready. Exists is an optimization of get where you don't need a copy of the value. Set passes the outgoing value and the time to live, and a future result for when the set is done. There is a common pattern in caches, when a cache miss happens to eliminate the race to set. There are lots of consistency questions for how to implement this, so we designed get-or-set: i want to see if its there, and if its not, compute the value. Get-or-set a key gives you a future that gives a variant: either its a hit, or we get a vacancy resource. The vacancy resource we can call a fill method on, which has the contents or the time to live. This is ergonomic from e.g. javascript, wit will come up with better ways to show.

Andrew Brown: Does the vacancy resource give exclusive access to the slot

Luke: We are giving the implementation the choice to implement this any way it wants - as much or little flexibility to rendezvous with other get-or-sets as it wants. Whatever is appropriate for that implementation.

Luke: The only consistency guarantee is that the cache will never give a result that nobody ever stored - this is the weakest possible guarantee. A valid implementation of this cache is the no-op cache - always has a miss. Something thats super persistent is also a valid implementation. There is a huge array for hosts to implement whatever cache they need.

Luke: We think this interface would be a thing we want added to the imports of the http proxy world, because this is a really common feature found in proxies and really useful for applications.

Kyle: do we guarantee that anything past its time to live wont be returned

Luke: modulo distributed systems definitions of time being a little fuzzy, yes.

Luke: please file issues on the wasi-keyvalue repo to discuss further

Bailey: Are there example implementations yet?

Joe: Not yet



#### Dan Gohman: CLI World and Resources

Dan: This is my personal fork of the io repo, I also have forks of the various other related proposals.

https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-io/compare/main...sunfishcode:wasi-io:resources#diff-d7278433294421dd40c269a9713850cdb52dc0d9e7da0ea7b9f3ccfdc420e19c

Dan: Using my own fork of joels fork of wit-bindgen to piece together all the pieces that are missing upstream.

Dan: Also we have a wasmtime implementation of handles. Fairly soon we will have an end-to-end resources system. Once it does I hope to update all the wasi proposals to use resources pretty quickly.

Dan: Once the transition to resources is done we will have all the features we needed for preview 2, so soon it will be time to talk about exactly what preview 2 means and how we’re releasing it.

Dan: I’m hoping next meeting we will have a proposal for two sets of criteria: one for what it means for a proposal to be part of preview 2, and another set of requirements for preview 2 to be launched. We want to see preview 2 will remain open so additional proposals that meet the requirements can be added to it.

Kyle B: Does that mean language implementors will see preview 2 as a moving target, that will change during implementation.

Dan: What most people want is for preview 2 is to be stable - once a proposal is in there it does not change. But we will allow adding new features - you can opt into new functionality that gets added to preview 2, but nothing we make part of preview 2 will break.

Pat: We expect the parts of preview 2 that get integrated in standard libraries to be part of the launch of preview 2 - the cli command world is what we had from preview 1 and gets integrated with standard libraries is intended to be part of the launch set for preview 2. We also want the http proxy worlds to be part of the launch, because the whole idea 

Kyle B: What about the templates idea with a more advanced cli experience

Pat: wit templating is on hold, if and when implementation picks back up in the future it wont be part of preview 2.

Dan: The typed main story is a place where the standard worlds for cli and proxy, we expect people to have their own custom worlds, where you can do typed main without needing it to be a wasi standard. So that is more of a thing that the ecosystem and tooling will enable, not explicitly connected to wasi preview 2 but something that can happen in parallel

Kyle: a typed main is just a normal function, so with good bindings generators like we are already doing, it will enable it. We need to solve those problems for the wasi proxy world.

Dan: Some guest languages are more tied to the idea of being in charge of the lifetime of their program via main anyway. So we have a struggle there for tooling no matter what
