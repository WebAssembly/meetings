##### Implementation status update

**Pat Hickey**: We’ve been implementing WASI Preview 2 within wasmtime. Wasmtime’s implementation hasn’t reflected the upstream standards very closely. Finally time to rectify this. 

Three PR’s to upstream changes needed found while implementing. 

PR for descriptor-flags: eliminate non-blocking flag, and therefore set-flags, https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-filesystem/pull/125

This is for the same file, we need to expose a stream that can be used in a blocking or non-blocking manner. It does not make sense to have a file opened as blocking or non-blocking. This removes the non-blocking flag. The blocking stream write/read is called, it is up to the implementation to make that operation blocking. 

Set-flags sets descriptor flags. Some operating systems do not support changing the descriptor flags. Since we can’t portably support this, then this is now excluded from being allowed to set-flags. Then due to the above change, there are now no contents in set-flags and this is it’s reason for removal.

We have not seen issues with this removal in practice within Wasmtime.

**Pat Hickey**: Delete preopens interface from package, replace with `wasi:filesystem/preopens`, https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-cli/pull/19. Preopens are more specific to a filesystem than a CLI app. This is now moved to the filesystem package. The initial cwd is moved into the environment package. Now the CLI world imports preopens from filesytem. This is largely a reorganization of content that already existed. Not expected to be an issue.

**Pat Hickey**: Add stream-status to stream write return values, and expand documentation PR, https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-io/pull/38

Any implementation of a pollable needs to fallback on the implementation in the host. Wasm does not have a concept of waiting so needs a host implementation. Adds back-pressure with blocking read. `stream-status` says whether the stream is open or ended. When writing (new in this PR), then if you get streams ended, this indicates that the stream is no longer being read.

If you write to a stream that is open, that is not necessarily guaranteed. We know for a fact that the other end of the stream is not going to read. This optimization seems to be the complement to read-end, and read had stream-status, now write has stream-status.

If the stream has ended, you can write successfully but the stream-status will say closed. If the stream-status is still open, then you will get zero-bytes in the write result indicating that you cannot write more bytes without blocking.

Besides resource-ification, this is the last significant change we have to streams.

**Pat Hickey**: Questions?

**Joel Dice**: Are socket preopens a thing (or going to be a thing)?
**Dave Bakker**: Preopens are not specific to a filesystem. This could refer to any component that needs to be preopened.

**Pat Hickey**: Prepopens exist as they are matching what we had in Preview 1. We desired to change that concept as little as possible as a migration path from Preview 1. The way I see preopens for files, it’s not just that this is a “here’s a file”, it’s a mapping to a path. This is similar to what other pieces of software call a mount, but these are not the same thing. This is why it is not called mounts. Opening new networks or new sockets is a fundamentally different type than what preopens are.

**Kyle Brown**: I've imagined that preopens will eventually evolve into value imports of resources or arguments of an exported function.

**Pat Hickey**: Right, this is the idea that we will be able to talk about values in WIT. WASI-CLI in stdio is get std-in is a function that always gets the same value. We cannot give you a value directly in the component import. This seems to be good enough to write programs with Preview 2, but this is something we want to do eventually. 

**Dave Bakker**: I had not given them much thought around preopens much significant consideration.

**Pat Hickey**: Preview 2 adapter does not support preview 1 sockets functionality to preview 2. This is not really our priority and instead focus on the preview 2 interface. We have yet to find anyone that depends on preview 1 sockets, and preopens functionality going away is an issue. Do let us know if this will impact your use-case.

**Dan Gohman**: This seems straightforward and something we may likely want to do.

**Dave Bakker**: I will create an issue and we can discuss more there. 

##### Preview 2 definition, as presented on 07-27

**Bailey Hayes** We’re still seeing active discussion on the presentations dan made last meeting. So, we delayed the vote to let that discussion continue. A lot of folks are still learning what these presentations mean so we are giving time for that.

**Petr Penzin** What is the actual change in the process?

**Dan Gohman** The core CG process had some ambiguity in their definition of phases (at phase 3 vs in phase 3) so they clarified the entry requirements vs what happens when in a phase for a given proposal. We are just porting that process change from the core CG to our process, to eliminate ambiguity.

**Petr Penzin** The later phases in WASI are not actually defined, whereas they are in the core CG. Not a request to change things

**Dan** This is about communication and clarity - is it confusing to have phase 4 and 5 there without any definition? Well, it shows a parallel structure, and our structure is not finished yet. We’ll discuss what the exact structure we need to finish this standard when we are ready, but its premature right now. The corresponding step to CG phase 4 is standardization. One possible outcome is we do a W3C Req for WASI. We aren’t about to start those discussions but that is an eventual possible path we could take if the CG and W3C are aligned.

**Petr** If we’re using the component model as our vehicle for defining interfaces, it becomes interesting to consider that the component model is not complete yet either. If its just a function definition and not an ABI it can be a convention not a standard.

**Dan** What matters is what a standard means, we want it to mean that many different implementations and languages can interoperate, so we don’t want ambiguity in what the 

**Petr** if we dont use the component model we dont use any new features from it, just existing ones

**Dan** from a process point of view the component model itself will become a standard at some point, it will be separate from the core wasm spec but the idea is it will be published in the same venue as the core spec. The CG publishes multiple specs today: the core spec and the JS embedding spec are separate but published in the same venue

**Petr** What about separate documents that dont require the same process

**Dan**, **Petr** (some discussion lost, notetaker couldnt keep up)

**Luke** in theory the CG and WG is not supposed to standardize anything thats not in their charter, sets the scope for the wasm CG and WG, for example the wasm cg couldnt start standardizing video codecs. The component model is going to be included in the next charter for the wasm CG/WG. WASI, since its IO, its not in the charter because it would be a blank check for any IO. Its not officially in the charter because we need to narrow it down to particular interfaces to be included in the wasm charter. So, the component model is further down the path of being in the wasm charter because it defines pure computation, not any IO.

**Petr** so in the current state of the wasm cg, WASI cannot become a standard because it is to broadly defined.

**Luke** the charters have a time limit, they get refreshed every 2 years, so when that period becomes due we can look at the WASI standards which are ready to be standardized and consider adding them to the charter.

**Petr** escape hatch is you can define the standard to be non-browser implementations

**Luke** that is possible but we also want to see the browsers natively implement some of the WASI standards which make sense for their context.

**Kyle**: I have one kinda detailed question about streams in Preview 2, but I'll save that unless we think it'd be a good use of time. I see a pathological case.

**Pat:** The host is able to optimize this in some situations. When making calls between components, not possible to optimize calls between components. When we first started talking about streams, we knew this would be a problem. Need to make the copy exactly the right amount into the linear memory to make this optimal. The fix for this is to have streams be a lower-level primitive to make this optimal. We have sketched this and think we can do it, but it is complex. We have pushed this out of Preview 2. The idea in Preview 3 is that all of wasi-io goes away where streams live. 

**Kyle**: Do we have a way to mitigate this in the preview 2 timeframe?

**Pat**: No we don’t have one of those right now.

**Dan**: Component to component streams will not be ideal for a variety of reasons. That fundamental lack of async, is more likely a blocking issue. Streams and pollables work as essentially callbacks by the hosts. The expectation is that this will not be a major use-case given preview 2’s limitations.

**Kyle Brown**: Streams are designed primarily for component to host. 

**Pat Hickey**: You can’t implement a poll-oneoff in pure WebAssembly. Any compositions that you do have to be nested such that these are consumed and orchestrated internally or orchestrated by the host. When delegating from the host, then dispatching from the host streams. Guy ran into this with wasi-virt. Wasi-virt has to import all of the pollables from the host and exports those to consuming components.

**Dan Gohman**: Discussion around stream-utils to aid in the wasi-virt type situation. If we have something like that, then we wouldn’t need to virtualize all of the
