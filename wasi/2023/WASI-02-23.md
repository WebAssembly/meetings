### wasi-cli proposal to Phase 1

**Dan Gohman**: This is a proposal to vote for Phase 1 for WASI CLI world. Moving to a format where we have a wit file, and then dependencies are vendored in. The deps dir would serve purpose of collecting everything in the cli world.

There’s a sketch in the issue linked in the agenda of what this world will look like. Some things will change, but that’s appropriate for phase 1.

**Lin Clark**: Vote. Any objection? No. Congrats on another proposal!

### wasi-sql-embed proposal to Phase 1

**Kyle Brown**: Compile something to run in database, UDFs, types. Describes how the types map, how you define. Will find links to sketches. Any questions, any one not familiar?

**Lin Clark**: Vote. Any objections? No. Congrats on your new proposal!

**Carlo Piovesan**: Question. One very minor bit of feedback: I’m not sure whether layering a bit more would allow to move faster. Seems that the scope is very wide.

**Kyle Brown**: Yes, scope of it is large. A number of different types we’re interested in. Might phase it within the proposal. May do more piece by picee. Original proposal has a sketch for all of it to demonstrate the scope.

**Carlo Piovesan**: SEems to be lots of material. Perhaps a subset coule be shipped earlier.

**Kyle Brown**: Definitely reasonable and can address the meta concerns.

### Open questions/announcements

**Andrew Brown**: WASI threads blog post

**Antoni Bofarull**: Hi! Is anyone planning to design a wasi interface for image processing?

**Lin Clark**: None in progress on proposals page. Any one in the room working on one? Looks like no
