#### SQL embedding proposal

**Kyle Brown**: Design doc. Outline of embedding wasm as user objects into a database. Several things that need to be solved. If embed component, have to identify user objects, and these overlap in their type. Could be single col value, could be series of col values. Need a way to disambig. Can emad in URL of different exports. UDF which takes in some num of col vals, as opposed to aggregate that takes in more than 1 row.

I believe URL no longer in wit, so need to figure that out. Need to identify different parts of type. For UD aggregate function, there are typically 4 funcs. Largely this can be done as an interface. Ways to generalize over these different kinds of function shapes. No structured annotations required.

Identifying user objects, identifying the parts of them. Last thing is SQL types the object corresponds to. Need to figure out what the SQL type is. Proposal is that for any default component value types, driver can choose to define map table. An option of an option of a value doesn’t have a high fidelity value in SQL, so would probably not allow you to map out.

Additionally, there’s the option to have some wrapper types, like new pattern in rust. The record type acts as a named alias that maps to SQL type. Much more control over how it gets into SQL context. Could install entire extension without out of band data.

Might want variations of user object, e.g. reduce way. If we present different APIs, they’d be different interfaces.

Interested in moving forward as a proposal

**Lin Clark**: Great, can add a poll to next week

**Dan Gohman**: Option option T

**Kyle Brown**: If you don’t define, driver can pick. When you pass state around. Precise types can vary. If you don’t have a fixed type mapping to your internal database types, you’d simply reject that. We’ll lose at which level the NULL is at. Variant types aren’t in the database. Largely a better idea to not use at the boundary of your UDF. Makes more sense to use what SQL type because you’re largely going to be using this in the database.

**Dan Gohman**: Some backends could support types that others dont

**Kyle Brown**: Any value would allow you to be compliant with the world no matter what the value is. That would be compliant with the world, but you might have additional validation

**Luke Wagner**: Another example: UDF that was incompat with the defined schema.

**Kyle Brown**: In that case, could bring in but then would be SQL error. If an init takes in a type, then other funcs will need to take that type. That would largely be an external validation.

Floated an idea of abstract interface. This interface needs a state type but doesn’t define what it is.

**Luke Wagner**: Thinking about it, if you said typestate = anyval, and use state everywhere, that pins down that you’re using the same type everywhere. That’s coming up in wit.

**Kyle Brown**: Great point. Maybe we’ll give it a go to see if we can get it to validate that way, then can do more in wit.
