### Announcement of Acting Chairs

**Lin Clark:** Not a surprise, explained in the issue that added this to the agenda. I have conflicts in the next few months, so two fantastic contributors—Pat Hickey and Bailey Hayes—are going to take on acting chair duties. Thank you both!

### Stage 1 vote for wasi-cloud-core

**Bailey Hayes:** Anything you want to add Joe? Basically means we’ll create the repo for it. Traditionally we have run a vote for if anyone is against this proposal. Open it up right now? Is anyone against moving forward with WASI cloud core?

**Jiaxiao Zhou:**  I actually prepared a short intro. I imagine most of you have already heard this proposal. It is an issue in wasi repo, 520. It’s a new world definition. World defines all the imports and exports of a component. This is the core set of func we want to do in distributed applications. Intended to support bursty workloads. We intend to support 80% of workloads. Last year, we proposed wasi-cloud set of interface proposals. Includes wasi-kv, etc. This is the concrete form of them all coming together. If you want to know even more background, portability you can watch our talk from CNCF Wsam Day. Most proposals have a draft under review. Please raise issues if you have questions. What’s interesting about wasi-cloud-core is that is does not expose lower level APIs like socket. That’s pretty different than the CLI world, which has lower level APIs. It will export a single HTTP handler. Include syntax not yet part of CM, but I’m working on that in issue 169 on CM repo. If you want to know more about include, I have a presentation from previous CG meeting.

Next step: I want to request vote to move to phase 1. Last I want to mention SpiderLightning, just our implementation. That’s how we’re verifying that these all make sense. If you’re interested, check it out.

**Pat Hickey:** So all those includes are what you said. What I’m missing is what’s inside each of those. What transitive dependencies does that imply. I don’t think we need to answer that in this moment. I think that’s just a tooling question we want to make really easy to answer. 

**Jiaxiao Zhou:**  I think semantics of include will do dedup. 

**Pat Hickey:** Right, we’re going to expect most if not all depend on HTTP. I think none of those imply depending on wasi-filesystem.

**Jiaxiao Zhou:**  No

**Pat Hickey:** The stuff I’m working on how libc integrates. THis doesn’t provide some things that your program might expect. The story we have there is this world doesn’t provide a filesystem, but if your program depends on it, then you need to compose your component with another component that provides those interfaces. So this is a case where what’s not in this world is actually important. 

**Jiaxiao Zhou:**  That’s a great point, that’s exactly what I was going to say. The power of virtualization plays a big role here. A component that uses wasi-cloud-core can be composed with a virtualed-fs that uses blob storage or kv. 

**Sam Clegg:** We’ll presumably have some flags in libc that target the cloud world

**Pat Hickey:** Dan Gohman just put up a PR that makes preopens lazy. If your libc never calls open, then you probably don’t need to populate the preopens table, which means at link time you don’t even include the preopens function. We’re hoping between laziness and link time optimization, we can get that effect. But we might also provide a flag for it—that’s a possibility.

**Bailey Hayes:** One thing to note: stdio is necessary. We got that working through composition with host APIs. That’s kind of the same idea, and it does work, so that’s kind of exciting

**Pat Hickey:** One other thing, the transitive dependency I’m imagining is wasi-logging

**Jiaxiao Zhou:**  it’s included in wasi-http

**Eduardo Rodrigues:** This takes the default world that is defined in wasi-kv. My assumption is that you’re just taking the default world

**Bailey Hayes:** Poll—Any objections?

### Heads up on PR

**Pat Hickey:** Not on the agenda, but just wanted to call out [a PR](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/193). Changes to wit syntax and packaging dependencies. We want to make some adjustments, and I think it’s pretty cool, so just want others to know about it.
