#### Discussion for reframing WASI to stand for "WebAssembly Standard Interfaces"

**Luke Wagner**: As a history, Oscar Spencer (Grain PL) in wasm i/o in barcelona last year, suggested to rename WASI to WebAssembly Standard Interfaces. The whole goal of these interfaces is that they are independent of the system and can be implemented virtually. The other part is that interfaces are plural, there are all of these possible interfaces to use, but people panic because thats a lot to implement themselves, we need them to understand that through virtualisation that isnt true, they only need to implement the small world they need.

I’m proposing this now, and we can collect feedback and then vote on it next meeting.

**Bailey** Is there a github issue for this?

**Luke** I will file one


**Bailey**: Personally I am in favor, and I’ve been using it in my presentations ever since I heard it

**Andrew Brown** I wonder if other people making interfaces will feel slighted because now theirs aren't the standard ones?

**Bailey** I’ve been calling them modular interfaces, we’re bootstrapping the ecosystem by making these foundational interfaces but we expect many ecosystems to build their own interfaces in the component model that don’t need to become part of WASI if it doesn’t serve their needs.

**Luke** It's also a problem with “system interfaces” - what, am I not the system if I’m not in WASI? 

**Kyle** (in chat) I like to think of it sort of like a standard library where we're creating some types to bootstrap the common cases and so that two people solving the same common problem are ideally using the same interface


#### WasmEdge and WASI Preview 2

**Michael Yuan**: Thanks Luke for inviting me here. I didn’t have time to prepare a comprehensive talk about our plans but I’ll give a quick introduction to our plans to implement preview 2.

https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2939

**Michael Yuan**: WasmEdge is a CNCF project building a Wasm runtime from the ground up for the server side. We chose C++ to build it because there were two leading Rust based engines already, and we saw value in an independent implementation in a different technology stack to provide more diversity in the ecosystem. There is very little code that is shared at a fundamental level between our runtime and others.
Our goal was to implement WASI from the beginning. We have two WASI implementations: one is integrated into our standalone runtime, and the other is made available as a plugin through our rust sdk, for rust host applications. When people start using WASM embedded in Rust host applications they have specific needs and its easier for the WASI implementation there to be written in Rust to work with their programs.

**Michael Yuan**: Our implementation has supported asynchronous sockets as well, so that a single WASM instance can make many network connections. That implementation of ours is nonstandard and we were looking for ways to get that into a standard. So it looks like Preview 2 provides that.

**Michael Yuan**: We have a Preview2 tracking issue, describing all of the preview 2 proposals we are planning to implement. Most of these already have an engineer assigned to them.

**Michael Yuan**: Our goal with Wasi IO and Sockets is to keep our existing applications working. Our users dont care how the low level implementation details of the sockets implementation work, they just want our Rust SDK and JS SDK to keep working the same when we switch the underlying code to be WASI Sockets. So, our difficult work there is to keep those existing applications working as we switch to WASI Preview 2.

**Michael Yuan**: One part we need help with is the filesystem proposal. For WASI preview 1 we have a solid implementation for linux and mac, and for windows with WSL, but in our community we dont have any true Windows expertise. We have had complaints about our Windows support, and we want our engine to work well on a native Windows system as well. It seems like the Windows filesystem is pretty different than the others, so that is one place where we have various bugs. We want some help from the community with those.

**Michael Yuan**: All of the plans in this tracking issue are about our C++ implementation. We haven’t decided what to do with our host Rust SDK yet. We may be able to borrow code from Wasmtime there, because they have done it. We reuse work that Wasmtime has done for the Rust host side of our SDK, such as fibers.

**Michael Yuan**: We saw that WASI-NN is also working on Preview 2. We are collaborating on WASI-NN and care a lot about it, because there are a lot of use cases. Wasi-NN isnt the low level system interface but it talks to high level functions implemented on the host. We want to work on more backends there to get support for new models and new ways… (notetaker lost track)... When WASI-NN makes it into preview 2 we will definitely support that, and we want to be at the forefront of working on the WASI-NN spec.

**Michael Yuan**: We hope to be in the first 3 runtimes to implement Preview 2, maybe even in the first 2. Our goal is to be a standard compliant runtime.

**Bailey**: Can you share where your implementation of the component model is underway?

**Michael Yuan**: (https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2943) Here is our tracking issue, we are doing a release at the end of this month with a lot of internal refactoring and support for function references, and GC. So in our next release it will bring WasmEdge up to speed for the prerequisite proposals, and then we will have an easier time making progress there. So here is our tracking issue, I know its not as detailed yet, but we are committed to supporting it.

**Luke**: Thank you, its very exciting to see another independent implementation, thats what makes these standards work.

**Bailey**: Wasmedge could really be one of the second implementations required for some of these proposals so we are excited about that.

**Michael Yuan**: One thing that is really valuable is a standard test suite. We have been getting issues filed by users who compare our implementation to Wasmtime, where we may have a different result. When we look into those issues, its often someplace that the spec isnt clear. So, we would like a test suite to help call ourselves compliant.

**Luke**: On test suites, we have work ongoing and plans to improve it a bunch in the coming months. At the component model level, folks from northeastern are working on a Ocaml reference interpreter (based on the wasm reference interpreter). So that will become WAST spec tests at the component model level. Another great idea from Till is to use the Web Platform HTTP tests that run as JS, componentize them, run them on WASI HTTP, and even use jco transpile to run it in the browser in its original test harness, or use a custom test harness to run it outside the browser to test host implementations. 

**Luke**: OCaml https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/192 (More work has happened since the, but not yet updated in the PR)

**Andrew Brown**: Checkout https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite

**Till**: Web Platform Tests is used to test Fastly’s JS Compute@Edge runtime. I’m working on porting that runtime over to WASI-HTTP and we can then use that same test suite to test wasmtime, and we expect that test runner can be generalized to run with wasmedge as well. Web Platform Tests is the most comprehensive test suite we know about for HTTP, and because its whats used by browsers it tests the actual Web as it exists.

**Michael Yuan**: Our Sockets implementation for async sockets has all kinds of issues around DNS behavior, how to interact with TLS libraries, whole host of issues. A comprehensive set of networking tests will really help us here.

**Colin**: That test suite doesnt have Preview 2 in it, does it?

**Til**l: The web platform tests isnt a WASI test suite as such, we will just make it one. WPT is a giant suite of shared tests that all the big browser vendors contribute to and run against their engines. Wpt.fyi is a dashboard of all the browsers and who passes what tests. We can reuse the tests that make sense for WASI, written in JavaScript use the Fetch implementation, and run those in a JS runtime that runs inside a Component Model runtime we can use that to exercise the WASI HTTP implementation. It tests the fetch implementation in terms of WASI-HTTP instead of WASI-HTTP directly, but it tells us we can implement a spec-compliant fetch in terms of WASI-HTTP. I’m working on the changes to the JS Fetch implementation that uses Fastly’s Compute@Edge API and make it work in terms of WASI-HTTP instead.

**Andrew Brown**: Shout out to the [WASI Testsuite repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite), Marcen has done the most work in there, the filesystem tests have found differences between different engines which is valuable. It is focused on Preview 1 right now, but we can improve it to deal with component model tests as well.

**Michael Yuan**: I will report back when we make more progress on our Preview 2 implementation.

#### Sharing feedback and status of Preview 2 ship plan

**Pat Hickey**: It wasn’t two weeks ago, but it was four weeks ago that I presented a plan for shipping Preview 2. I got feedback it was great. The earlier you give feedback, the better and more we can do about it. Please continue giving that feedback, you can contact me directly, or you can make an agenda item to deliver feedback to the group in one of these WASI meetings.

**Pat Hickey**: A couple of points from that feedback. Last week we talked about two implementations for the portability criteria in the phase process. There is a third implementation that is just an implementation of the wasi-http proxy world. The entire HTTP layer is written specifically for Fastly’s compute@edge edge daemon. It has a set of requirements that is more stringent than even wasmtime. This is for multitenant and managing backends in a fastly-specific way. Unfortunately this is closed source so we won’t be able to share it in the way that we can share the other implementations with JCO and wasmtime. 

**Pat Hickey**: At some point it will ship to production but it has not shipped yet. Adam Foltzer is the lead on that project, he has given very valuable feedback on the wasi-http spec, and has been raising issues as we implement this spec together.

**Pat Hickey**: I’d like to give an update on wasmtime. Wasmtime 14 is shipping tomorrow and has a lot of new changes for HTTP and also lands resources support. Dan Gohman updated all of the WASI spec repos to use resources instead of u32’s (pseudo-resources). We had to shake out a lot of tooling issues. So wasmtime is shipping with that.

**Pat Hickey**: With wasmtime 15, we will be shipping with release candidates of the WASI Specs. We haven’t cut release candidates yet because the specs were still changing too rapidly. Alex Crichton has been working on getting versioning support through all of the tools so that we can pin to versions by wasmtime 15.

**Pat Hickey**: This means with wasmtime 15 will be able to say we aren’t using wasmtime’s flavor of the specs but the upstream WebAssembly WASI specs, at a particular version.

**Pat Hickey**: Yosh and Wassim from Microsoft have started working on the JCO runtime, bringing the team from 1 engineer to 3. We appreciate their leadership, they are new fresh eyes looking at these specs for the first time. They are both experts in JS and so this adds to the diverse set of expertise implementing these specs.

**Pat Hickey**: Release cadence is something a lot of folks have asked for. Certainly a consensus of the group is that 4 years is too long. This is essentially because we needed to invent the component model. We are never going to make that big of a change again in WASI. This level of big change will be behind us once we ship Preview 2.

**Pat Hickey**: We would like to build consensus to release a WASI preview every year. Historically, we have said async will ship in preview 3, but that may take more time to implement than a year, we can't be sure. So we would like to scope preview 3 to be a year after preview 2 incorporating whatever new features and proposals are done and stable. Stability defined by this consensus-driven process across the many vendors participating in this subgroup.

**Pat Hickey**: The other thing we can do after shipping preview 2 is ship patch releases for individual proposals, as 0.2.1 or 0.2.n+. Additive changes can be made as incremental updates to the current preview. We are not going to try to make super big leaps like changing the ways filesystemswork or something like that - not changes that will divide the ecosystem. The goal is to be able to extend the preview without making breaking changes and reserve breaking changes for the 0.n or Preview level changes.

**Pat Hickey**: One example of work we are setting aside for a patch release, Dan Gohman has done a great deal of work specifying how filesystem permissions might work. But we don't have an implementation done in time for Preview 2. If we can find a way to that as an extension in a 0.2.n, then that would be ideal, it can be shipped without making a breaking change, just new APIs you can opt into using and supporting.

**Pat Hickey**: Doing a preview every year, that makes it so that it is possible to make breaking changes every year so that we have a window to do that so that we are not stuck with major problems for a long time.

**Petr Penzin**: I think the issue is JCO being an implementation is the issue. I think the main concern that I have in using JCO as an implementation is that it’s not a runtime. It doesn’t manage the state of the module in the runtime. There is a difference between managing the state yourself vs providing wrappers around it. Wasm2c even though it is not a web engine, it does manage the state itself. That’s the concern. Somebody said before in the core standard that I’m in the minority on this.

**Pat Hickey**: We’re going to invite the JCO team to come in and present on their work so that they can give more details on this.

**Dan Gohman**: Not just JCO but it’s a combined thing with Node.

**Luke Wagner**: A lot of these WASI implementations it’s calling into another system. It’s not about implementing this thing totally from scratch but be able to meaningfully interact with mac, windows, and linux. So with the sockets, we want to map to the implementations that you want to talk to. Really what JCO is doing is getting from WASI to an existing implementation.

There is also a third, closed source, implementation with wasi HTTP but is distinct from the upstream.

**Petr Penzin**: My concern is that if you take an engine about taking wasmtime and then building a wrapper around wasmtime. I totally understand your argument that you still have the complexity to implement the full spec. In the same ways we think about it, in the web we want web engines. When you implement something in the browser it takes a lot more effort to tie into the browser it’s much more complex. Many things can come your way and usually browsers take more so sets a higher barrier of entry. We’re setting a lower barrier of entry where we’re setting a precedent for allowing wrappers.

**Luke Wagner**: I think you’re right about setting a high-bar before standards. In this case we’re talking about a preview. We’re putting this out there to get feedback. Our relatively lower bar is indicative of a preview stage proposal. This is to get us to a place to where we can advance to the next stage of the standardization process.

**Petr Penzin**: Then yeah, let’s defer this a little further until we get more people.

**Kyle Brown**: It's not like we're counting the browser or node twice. So Wasmtime vs. JCO+browser is two fully independent implementations which address the full complexity of modules and components. That's what we're going for if I'm not mistaken and I don't think it being "easier" than other options should hurt the argument.

#### Backtrace API 

**Andrew Brown**: I was troubleshooting, doing some printf style debugging. I realized I needed a backtrace. In this case I couldn’t trap which is how I usually get a backtrace. I talked to Nick about it and we realized that adding an API for this would be helpful. This would let us get a backtrace at anytime. I created a zulip thread for this. If we could and you’re interested, then please chime in. Before I do more work on this, I want to know if this would be generally more useful for others. When you need it, you really need it. https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219900-wasi/topic/new.20backtrace.20API.3F
