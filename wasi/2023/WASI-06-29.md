#### Vote to advance wasi-sockets to phase 2

Reminder: [phases process](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/phases.md)

Continuation of last week's Vote: Advance wasi-sockets to phase 2. In this discussion we will discuss some of the Phase 4 advancement criteria for the proposal.

**Dave Bakker:** Concern last time about what it means to be POSIX compatible. Do we have any special requirements regarding the socket? PR document that details the mappings. Main goal today is to define the advancement criteria.

**Chris Woods:** Dan Gohman suggested as an advancement criteria, show that the interface is capable of supporting an existing piece of software. Discussion on a GitHub issue in the meantime and the document for a bit of existing software (e.g. rust and python).

**Chris Woods:** What about openSSL? For an advancement criteria, looking for some assertion that we have some level of support.

**Dave Bakker:** Drafted document in [wasi-sockets PR](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sockets/pull/40/files)

**Dave Bakker:** The most ambiguity is in the socket options. After going through multiple code bases and observing which options are typically used. Most are single-platform. Only the top is cross-platform and used across projects.

**Chris Woods:** Maybe openssl isn’t too large of a project to display support?

**Dave Bakker:** Gut is that only one project is insufficient for defining phase 4. There is a lot of stuff that is not used anywhere and can be eliminated quickly. The remainder is used for multiple software packages using this. If more than one uses this software option, then we should include it as supported or have a very clear definition of why it is not included. For example SO_ERROR will not be supported because this will be supplied by native sync support within the component model.

**Dave Bakker:** Two others for example will not be included because they are specific for raw sockets and therefore is out of scope for this standard.

**Dave Bakker:** We could take a subset of this table and all of the ones used by one piece of software and declare that as something that will be specified by WASI.

**Bailey Hayes:** Entry requirements:

- Precise and complete overview document is available in a forked repo around which a reasonably high level of consensus exists.
U- pdates to the actual spec document, test suite, and reference interpreter are NOT yet required.

**Pat Hickey:** No votes against. wasi-sockets moves to phase 2.

#### Pat: Versioning of pre-release proposal wits

[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t8rTwkJA28IvFvyqy3K49jy8Sm0xUsk-vZssFAruD8o/edit?usp=sharing)

We do not have a reliable way to make updates to specs (yet), which means every change is a breaking change.

There are two host implementations:
- Wasmtime
- JCO -> related to Wasmtime

Do let us know if implementation is underway for other hosts.

Proposal repos reflect what we need

On the guest side, most are using a project from wasmtime that is called the wasi-preview-1-component-adapter.

When using the component adapter, this “locks-you-in” on the version of the proposals when this adapter was built. This covers the ground that was already covered in preview 1.

For all other interfaces, we do not have or need this component adapter. For all other components it invokes wit-bindgen. Inside JCO there is some tooling for transpilation.

What do you feed into wit-bindgen? Feed wits manually written, a git submodule, sometimes with wit-deps, but the ultimate goal is to use a component registry. The goal in the near-ish future is to use the registry for wasmtime.

WIT has versions now. Poll is the one thing that you can’t live without because this is how blocking is implemented. Streams build on poll. <Pat displays an example wit of these>

Version syntax is semver. Major.minor.patch-<pre-release suffix>. 
Proposed versioning scheme. We’re looking to ship preview 2, it’s not 2.0 it’s something pre-1.0.
We’re focused on shipping preview 2. We know we want this release to be `0.2.0`. We are not defining the release that comes after preview 2.

0.2.0-rc-2023-06-29.1

ISO 8601 Date.
Monotonically increasing number for “goofs”. Integer that is an escape hatch if we need it.

Pre-release process:
Take the grammar previously shown and make a PR to the proposal repo. The proposal repo has a CI step that validates the WIT using wasm-tools to validate.

Merge PR to main, create a git tag with -a. `git tag -a v<version number>`.
The MVP would publish a release. Improvement would be publishing to a registry.
Expected cadence to be about once a month.

**Frank Schaffa:** Just thinking aloud: suggest we use something based on cargo package toml, that will apply to all, except ones that have explicit notation

**Pat Hickey:** We aren’t ready to add the registry tooling yet. But that could be an optional solution.

**Bailey Hayes:** Talk with Guy and Peter showing this off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCIwpc7x4jU

**Till Schneidereit:** I think it should always be possible to use WASI and WASI's WIT definitions without depending on a registry that's not owned by the Wasm CG. Obviously that doesn't rule out using a registry as an optional thing, but it shouldn't be a hard requirement

**Jiaxiao Zhou:** When we release release WIT version, do we also want to release a wit-bindgen version?
Ideally each WIT version should be bundled with a wit-bindgen version
I would appreciate to hear your takes on https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/issues/46
Specially about releasing client bindings together with WIT release.

**Eduardo Rodrigues:** https://crates.io/crates/wasi-preview2-prototype

**Pat Hickey:** First we’re aiming to standardize the versioning for wasi WIT files.

**Eduardo Rodrigues:** It makes sense for us to have some base implementation. Difficulty re-implementing within JavaScript for wasi-http.

**Pat Hickey:** We want to begin hearing feedback on issues with implementation to strengthen the standard.

**Pat Hickey:** We do not have a reasonable way to patch and work on a CVE within an org that is open to everyone.

**Pat Hickey:** Reinforces Till’s chat message that a working registry should not be a requirement to use a standard.
