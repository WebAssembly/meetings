### Notes

Pat Hickey: We have combined all of the agenda items on one slide deck that Bailey, Guy, and I created yesterday: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uVlz5JnSWm2vldLiaseSACTS0UI1bVKiWt0CxNAs7_Y/edit?usp=sharing

Pat Hickey: Review of agenda

### Phase criteria and Consensus reminders

Pat Hickey: We are voting today to advancement from phase 2 to phase 3. This is a review of the criteria for entry requirement to phase 3. The portability criteria must already be met or there is a plan to meet this criteria.

Pat Hickey: Phase 3 essentially means finish building the proposal. In order to launch preview 2, the proposals must be in phase 3. This is have a guarantee of stability. Any future versions that are tagged, we give the ability to virtualize those APIs. This means only additions to preview 2.

Pat Hickey: The core WebAssembly CG has this procedure for how consensus is reached. We are only recording the aggregate votes. The chair determines if consensus has been reached.

### Wasmtime implementation status


Pat Hickey: Last time we gave an update on the Wasmtime implementation status. One thing that is different is that we now have a tag and github release that is marked as a pre-release. `0.2.0-rc-2023-11-10`. Since this date, we have identified two bugs in the http spec and a rename in the wasi:cli spec. Hopefully those are the last changes. Everytime we make a release candidate, we are hoping that this is the final version but leaving open for changes given implementation feedback.

Pat Hickey: We have approximately 99 integration test programs that exercise this set of proposals. The CI runs these test across many different OS’s and architectures including linux, macOS, and Windows. 

Till Schneidereit: In Fermyon Spin’s implementation embedding we have this snapshot of this RC. We have a full implementation of the previous snapshot. The November 11th snapshot, there should be very few changes. This is good validation for us being close to the finish line.

Bailey Hayes (in chat): wasmCloud has also embedded this set of proposals and can confirm they are working well

### JCO implementation status

Guy Bedford: In collaboration with Microsoft, we’ve been working on this for the last couple of months. When I last presented this, I gave the current progress on the status of the tests. Since then we’ve been able to make a lot of progress. We’re now at 80/99 tests passing. 

Guy Bedford: random, io, clocks, 100% implemented and tested.

Guy Bedford: For filesystem there is some new implementations and edge cases that need to be worked out. The same for cli.

Guy Bedford: For http we are now 100% complete. The trailers and request options we could support if we move to the optimized implementation in Node.js.

Guy Bedford: In the process we’ve been asking sort of all of the stupid questions, and we’ve created a set of issues. There are a couple of things that we need to add to our implementations in terms of flushing behaviors but we have been able to successfully get the information we needed to create implementations.

Guy Bedford: The remaining work includes `jco serve` and we’re on track to have this complete before the end of the year. The follow up to that is the low-level performance optimization for Node.js.

### Vote: advance wasi-io to Phase 3

Pat Hickey: If there are no other questions, we will begin. You just heard how wasmtime has met the portability criteria and JCO has a plan to meet it.

Marcin: What is the second implementation?
Pat Hickey: JCO

Marcin: Is it done?

Pat Hickey: We reviewed that it is nearly complete but not done yet. The phase 3 criteria only requires that there is a plan for this criteria to be met.

Sbc: The tests for wasi-io are 100% complete.

Guy Bedford: The missing implementations are related to POSIX systems and not the new Preview 2 idioms.

Till Schneidereit: It’s important to note that there are multiple wasip1 implementations and so this should be a known set of work.

Pat Hickey: The vote passes.

### Vote: advance wasi-filesystem to Phase 3

Oscar Spencer: Is there a clear plan for how this portability criteria will be met?

Guy Bedford: The simple answer is that I prioritized getting http working over everything else. The cases are about working through the implementations for filesystem. It’s the preview 1 style edge-cases that we need to complete on. We have precedent of doing this in node code for WASI preview 1.

Pat Hickey: As the implementer of wasi-filesystem. The edge cases take some time to go through but it’s never been hard. We’ve never run into architectural challenges. Filesystems have edge cases and are messy. It’s about getting to a reasonably cross-platform place for these. If Wasmtime can do it, then so can JCO.

Kyle Brown: What is the dependency on clocks?

Pat Hickey: There are timestamps.

Sbc: That’s just a data type dependency.

Pat Hickey: Yup. 

Sbc: To be fair you could implement wasi-filesystem without implementing clocks.

Kyle Brown: It’s not a dependency of the interface but of the type.

Pat Hickey: In wasi-io pollable input stream and output stream are resource type so those associated methods will also be imported. In wasi-clocks, there are no resources.

Till Schneidereit (in chat): and the data types are structurally typed in the case of timestamps, so an implementation wouldn't need to pull in anything from wasi-clocks, really

Pat Hickey: You could have a fully conformant implementation that never depends on wasi-clocks by name.

| ------ | -- |
| **SF** | 13 |
| **F**  | 9 |
| **N**  | 0 |
| **A**  | 0 |
| **SA** | 0 |

Pat Hickey: The vote passes.

### Vote: advance wasi-sockets to Phase 3

Pat Hickey: The wasmtime test suite for this is very good in my opinion. The JCO implementation is half-done.

Pat Hickey: The dependencies on this are wasi-io and wasi-clocks. I genuinely don’t know where the wasi-clocks dependency is.

Wassim Chegham: The duration type is used.

Matthew Yacobucci: How is 1/2 done measured? By number of tests passing?

Wassim Chegham: More than half of the tests passing. The other half is for TCP accept and UDP send/receive. We will be working on them the next month.

Guy Bedford: It’s not an excellent measure. Each test program tests an entire set of end to end set of tests. We’re measuring the number of test programs.

Andrew Brown: Is it safe to assume that the Node.js API makes implementing this relatively straightforward but it will be more difficult to implement in the browser?

Wassim Chegham: Right now we are focusing on the Node.js implementation.

Guy Bedford: We don’t currently have an implementation for the browser. It’s not currently on the roadmap as it were, and have been focused on the Node.js implementation for the time being.

Pat Hickey: Part of the idea there is that if you are targeting a world, then you should target a world that will be able to run in the browser. The wasi-http world is very intentionally written to not depend on sockets so that components can target wasi-http and run in the browser. If you’re targeting a world to run in the browser, then you’re either going to rely on a tool like wasi-virt to have null sockets. This is a tool that’s available to deal with some of these problems but this isn’t what we’re voting on today.

Sbc: Emscripten does have a very roundabout way of supporting web socket. You can do it but it is a real pain.

Syrus Akbary (in chat): I analyzed Sockets and was pretty solid tbh.

| **SF** | 16 |

Pat Hickey: The vote passes.

### Vote: advance wasi-cli to Phase 3

Syrus Akbary: Past week I analyzed the things we are voting on. While I think wasi-sockets is solid, I don’t see any of things tagged along in wasi-cli. 

Pat Hickey: We haven’t had anyone pursue that yet. We have provided functionality for is-a-tty. We left the ability to add additional methods to this resource that would be backwards compatible. If you target this world, you will always be able to run on future virtual worlds. At this time this hasn’t been added to the wasi-cli. 

Joel Dice (in chat): WIT versions are really helpful here

Syrus Akbary: To be clear, one of the things that appear to be missing is termsize. I think this is critical of cli applications.

Kyle Brown: Is there something here that is missing and could be added versus something that is incorrect? This perhaps changes the blocking nature of this.

Kyle Brown: There are things that we have lots of consensus on and there are others that we can add later.

Till Schneidereit: for one specific thing about tty support: there are significant portability and security concerns around ANSI escape codes, which is why we deliberately forbade them in the past. Adding support for them in the CLI world would require substantial analysis and design

Guy Bedford: In this case the node.js behavior has a different stand-in. 

Syrus Akbary: I read what Till posited. I am more unsure. I would like to know if there is a plan?

Pat Hickey: That is a great technical discussion to go in depth on in the wasi-cli repo. We are pressed for time in this meeting right now. 

Till Schneidereit: The vote is not about what might not be in a future point. This vote is about if there is something that will technically preclude the addition of the feature. This is what is up for a vote today.

Dan Gohman (in chat): The stdio api in wasi-cli is specifically designed to be extended with terminal support in the future.

|        |    |
| ------ | -- |
| **SF** | 13 |
| **F**  | 11 |
| **N**  | 0 |
| **A**  | 1 |
| **SA** | 0 |

Syrus Akbary: Just to be clear, I think the proposal is half complete. And there are things that I consider critical for running CLIs. For this reason, I’ll vote against this one

Pat Hickey: The vote passes as consensus is largely held.

### Vote: advance wasi-http to Phase 3

|        |    |
| ------ | -- |
| **SF** | 15 |
| **F**  | 8 |
| **N**  | 0 |
