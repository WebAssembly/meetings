### Poll for reframing WASI to stand for "WebAssembly Standard Interfaces" (WASI/#563) (Luke Wagner)

**Luke Wagner**: Last week we had an agenda to discuss and give the rationale for it. No one disagreed and no one has disagreed on the issue. Would someone like the rationale?

**Syrus Akbary**: I would like the rationale

**Luke Wagner**: This is an Oscar Spencer idea. This could be committed by other Wasm that can then be composed together to run on another host. We are not talking about a single monolithic set of interfaces that a host must implement all of them, instead a modular set. There is not one singular instead this is a transition to plural interfaces.

**Luke Wagner**: Any other discussion before we vote?

**Syrus Akbary**: I have concerns. One of those is because we are centralizing on what it means on an interface. Who this decides on the right one. Concern is on decentralization of what is official and what is not official. 

**Luke Wagner**: Is your concern specific to the naming concern?

**Syrus Akbary**: Yes, we’re moving from very similar to the POSIX. Centralizing what it looks like with what not general APIs look like. Central entity that defines what DBs, events, etc look like.

**Luke Wagner** That makes sense to have as a discussion in each individual proposal, the content of that particular proposal. But this is a standards group so we are establishing standards. The only shift we are proposing here is whether the interfaces we are proposing are exclusively implemented by the system. Otherwise there could be meta-discussion about the proposals and the scope, but the name change isn’t the place to sort that out.

**Syrus Akbary**: OK, we can discuss the other these. I do not want to hold the vote so if no one has any other discussion then I am ok with moving forward with the vote.

**Pat Hickey**: OK going to hold for 30 seconds to give time for any other concerns.

**Pat Hickey**: We hold these with unanimous consent. Speak up or comment in the zoom chat to object to the name change proposal.

**Syrus Akbary**: Concerned about centralizing certain ABIs. 

**Pat Hickey**: OK then the vote has not passed.

**Luke Wagner** In the Wasm CG, most votes are in the strongly in favor with strongly in favor. This is not a unanimously consent. 

**Syrus Akbary**: Would appreciate the chance to discuss a little bit more.

**Luke Wagner**: Ok we can delay it two weeks

### Wasmtime implementation status update (Pat Hickey, 20 mins)

**Pat Hickey**: I don’t have slides. The implementation of wasmtime for preview 2 is going really well we think. What we have completed so far is a wasi-cli command world. The basic I/O, sockets, filesystem, CLI specific things, stdio, and a couple other things. That has been implemented for a little while now with additional work in particular landing for sockets. 

The second world we are targeting is the wasi-http proxy world. In wasmtime 14 which is out now is the first time we have shipped an implementation of that with the new wasmtime CLI with `wasmtime serve` that implements as an http server using a wasi-http proxy component.. 

We are working on contributing to the wasi-http spec for how to represent errors. That is what we believe to be one of the last pieces of the puzzle to figure out. We are taking care of things like getters and setters for requests and responses, and how to handle and describe those errors. The PR that is up now includes this description.

That is the implementation status. Our goal for wasmtime 15 is to stop changing the WIT specs. As we approach preview 2, we are aiming to be stable. We will do this with a release candidate of all of the WASI preview 2 proposals. This includes WASI I/O, random, clocks, filesystem, and sockets. 

In short we will create a version with 0.2.0-rc-<date>. We have been working to stay in sync and so in wasmtime 15 we will do everything we can do to be stable. This will allow for interop with the other implementations that are in progress. 

The other goal there is that anyone making changes, then they can make their own services stable and keep their components running. The goal is to be able to turn this release candidate into Preview 2 with a vote if it remains stable.

Any questions, concerns, or comments?

**Colin**: We’ll lockdown wasi-clocks? Will this be a graduated approach?

**Pat Hickey**: We will be locking in the WebAssembly org wasi repos. This is separate from locking down the cap-std project. We have always been on an eventual consistency between wasmtime and upstream wasi specs. The implementation can change.

**Colin Murphy**: To make changes to wasi-clocks, it required changes to cap-std. I’m imagining this requires a waterfall of releases from WebAssembly org into cap-std. There are WIT interfaces that had to be updated to cross between the three repos.

**Pat Hickey**: In WebAssembly org, we think we are very close to settling those WIT specs. We have a project board that keeps this project tracking board that we use to keep track of various Preview 2 things between individual contributors. wasi-sockets tweaks and wasi-http implementations needed to be reflected up to WebAssembly org. 

Whatever changes we have to do between wasmtime or cap-std we will do to sync with the WebAssembly org.

Are there any other comments before we move on to the next presentation?

###Jco implementation status update (Guy Bedford, 20 mins)

**Guy Bedford**: JCO implementation of WASI. Update on where we are currently and how that implementation is working. For those of you who don’t know, JCO is a JavaScript toolchain for Wasm components with npm install -g jco

**Guy Bedford**: What we have been adding is full WASI support for these components.

**Guy Bedford**: Who is working on it? Myself, I have been at Fastly for a year and I have a background as a Node.js Collaborator and I am a TC-39 delegate. As well as help from Microsoft engineers Yoshua Wuyts, and Wassim Chegam, who is also a Node.js Collaborator.

**Guy Bedford**: WASI on Node.js. Our hope is that the experience we get when implementing WASI with jco is that we can have WASI work well in the Node.js project. I am also a maintainer of the Node.js project.

**Guy Bedford**: JCO recently added support for running command line components with the CLI world and now we are working on adding a serve command similar to wasmtime. This will let us demonstrate the wasi-http-proxy world.

**Guy Bedford**: Our implementation goals will let us get full support for all component model features. Now the focus is on full WASI conformance for both the serverside in Node.js and on the browser side. We are pulling in the wasm test suite and making sure we can pass all of those tests.

**Guy Bedford**: Experimental support right now while figuring out the architecture. Partial implementations on I/O. HTTP supports basic request/response. HTTP on the web is not yet supported. Sockets is not yet supported on server-side but should have this updated soon. Clocks shouldn’t be too tricky to finish up. Filesystem has partial support and internally JCO uses it’s own filesystem implementation.

**Guy Bedford**: The current implementation is experimental but come to good grips with the architecture at this point. Expecting to reach full support for WASI APIs on Node.js /JS server runtimes by EOY. Delay into Jan/Feb may be possible.

**Syrus Akbary**: Is JCO for supporting the core node libraries?

**Guy Bedford**: When you say using the Node.js API do you mean building on top of the Node libraries?

**Syrus Akbary**:  Not exactly, I meant being able to run Node.js Applications in JCO

**Guy Bedford**: That’s not exactly what JCO is doing. As a general toolchain project is that it is a little bit like a swiss army knife. When running a component in Node.js, we are supporting the WASI component APIs in Node.js. We want to maintain full correctness of the Node.js APIs with what we are implementing. There is a path for lowering the values to the platform via the C APIs for performance but for now the goal is for correctness first.

**Guy Bedford**: Supporting in Node.js and supporting in a browser have two implementations. In the immediate term, we are focusing entirely on ensuring compliant server-side implementation. The browser implementations are important, but to avoid diverting effort, we’re focusing on the Node.js Perview 2 support until after the Preview 2 release.

**Luke Wagner**: Who will use this in production? Likely node.js, bun, and deno that will likely use this meaningfully first. The current language says “browser fetch API”, and it would have been better to have the language say two implementations as we say in other proposals. Based on this feedback and implementation experience, it would make sense to tweak that criteria to two implementations.

**Pat**: We were hoping to vote to launch Preview 2 by the end of the year. If we remove this particular criteria, then we will have met that with working in the Node.js implementation. We think that doing fetch is really good and useful, but by deferring for right now, this makes sense for meeting our timeline.

**Pat**: Luke will make a PR to wasi-http with the language change. Since that language has already been voted on as part of making wasi-http phase 2, we will vote to change it. If folks want to discuss that in this meeting now, feedback is welcome now as well as outside of this meeting, comment on the wasi-http PR or talk to Luke or I via email, zulip, or schedule a call.

**Colin Murphy**: I have a question for Guy if we have time at the end.

**Pat**: Does anyone have feedback specifically on this criteria change? Luke is going to create a PR for this change. Thank you Guy and Luke.

### Propose wasi-backtrace (Andrew Brown, 10 mins)

**Andrew Brown**: wasi-backtrace. The reason for proposing this now is to gather feedback is to learn if we should target this in WASI. The reason I started working into wasi-backtraces as an option was triggered from conversations with Nick Fitzgerald. I was debugging a deadlock and because we don’t have full debugging support yet in WebAssembly engines. If I can insert a backtrace call, then I can get the backtrace I needed. Nick suggested we should make this a WASI API. I started asking around who is interested in this idea. Java devs thinks this would be helpful for them to print exception stacktraces in Java.

**Joel Dice**: I am very interested in this but I’m not sure when I’ll be in a place to work on this now.

**Andrew Brown**: This looks like a function with a capture-backtrace that prints a list of frames. This could give us easier to read stacktrace. Nick pointed out that this could be used also to help with coredump stacktraces. 

**Colin Murphy**: Is this compatible with what Chrome did?

**Andrew Brown**: Not sure?

**Piotr**: Why do we need this in Wasm applications when this is something that Wasm engines add?

**Andrew Brown**: If I trap, then I take down all of the threads. I need something to capture backtraces as it goes along without trapping. Ideally if we had old client/server debugging, this might have also helped answer this problem.

**Andrew Brown**: Due to how wasmtime implements it’s APIs. The backtrace is only accessible on the store, and that’s only on a caller. You can’t touch the caller thus the store. This is one of the cases where we need to touch the host properties in order to get to the backtrace. Lifting and lowering this frame structure would be complex and fragile. Hoping we can have a better way of doing that and just flagging this as an issue. Requesting this as a chance for feedback. I want to know if people think we shouldn’t do this. If folks are interested in this, I want to know that too. I want some feedback on this idea. 

**Luke Wagner**: Is the direction towards programming and diagnostic or do you imagine that this could be a critical part of the runtime via a language feature.

**Andrew Brown**: Motivated by my own needs here. I think Joel may be able to add his needs.

**Joel Dice**: Yes it would be helpful for exceptions in Java. Manually maintaining frame metadata is complex and having something built into the runtime like a stacktrace capability would be really nice. 

**Luke Wagner**: I am asking because over the years there has been discussion of walking the stack proposals. It could be a core wasm proposal and if it is a part of the core part of a wasm proposal. 

**Andrew Brown**: Someone did mention this but I thought maybe not today.

**Luke Wagner**: We want to make these locals opt-in. There is a lot of serious low-level compilery constraints that have to be addressed by this.

**Andrew Brown**: One of the benefits of this is a way to gauge the need for something like this in WASI then motivates pushing that stack walking proposal in core wasm.

**Colin Murphy**: I think this is great especially if we’re going to have multiple languages implement this. 

**Zalim Bashorov**: Yeah! o/ Let's have it!

**Syrus Akbary**: I agree that this should sit in the Wasm Core, it would be useful for Wasm runtimes in general

**Syrus Akbary**: I disagree placing it on WASI, but would agree placing it on the Wasm Core

**Kyle Brown**: I'm somewhat curious if the implementation complexity in Wasmtime indicates that this isn't the right place for it, but I am personally neutral

**coshvji cujmlqef**: what about 64 bit wasi? they forced address to be 32 bit

**Andrew Brown**: You're talking about this PR, right? ttps://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/444 Let’s push this to two weeks from now. Bring the wasi-sdk and libc and we can have a discussion on why this needs to be a WASI thing and not a library thing. 

**Colin Murphy**: Question for Guy. Is this really so that you can fit into other kinds of frameworks? Is that the number one argument for WebAssembly for Node.js? How do you try to convince people to use it for node applications.

**Guy Bedford**: There is no really convincing at the end of the day. Node.js already supports wasi preview 1 and we’d like to support preview 2. To have it include this js toolchain technology is helpful so that js devs have access to components. Treating Node.js as an embedding target is valuable.

**Colin Murphy**: So JCO is really an enablement tool for users who want to embed their code in existing Node.js apps and infrastructure. If you want to run CLI or reactor style components then you can have it embedded in js to be called respectively.

**Luke Wagner**: You can have this run on existing Node.js infrastructures. 

**Colin Murphy**: The question is if JCO brings something new for Node.

**Joel Dice**: running sandboxed components written in any language from within a JS app (browser or Node) has appeal for a lot of people

**coshvji cujmlqef**: there is a project which is wasm2lua. world of Warcraft runs lua as its addons.

**Colin Murphy**: Sounds like it is all of the key why Wasm arguments.

—------

Straw vote in chat results: 1 SF, 5 F, 2 N, Syrus prefers it be in core Wasm instead of WASI.
