### Wasi-crypto

**Frank Denis:**  We have discussions in the issues at WebAssembly/wasi-crypto, and bi-weekly meetings. There haven’t been meetings for a few weeks but they are back on now.
**Frank Denis:**  The why of wasi-crypto: performance for using native implementations of crypto, compliance requires you use certain implementations that have been reviewed/certified, security to keep keys opaque and mitigate side channels, and also all languages using wasi get to use a common implementation. Some new languages e.g. grain dont have implementations of their own right now so they can just rely on wasi-ctypto

**Frank Denis:**  The specification is still in progress, new apis are required for additional function classes: field arithmetic, batch operations. Constraints are that it must be compatible with a wide range of platforms, and stable by supporting current and future algorithms without breaking changes. The new features we are working on are incremental additions.

**Frank Denis:**  there are two implementations today: wasmedge is the most up-to-date, and there is one in wasmtime that you need to apply a PR on top of to make it up-to-date.

**Frank Denis:**  the todo list for the project: build an ecosystem on top of this spec. Libraries exist today for AssemblyScript, and two in Rust (wasi-crypto-guest, crypto-wasi). These are just bindings over the interface, not what end users should be expected to use. Real world users want transparent support in a JWT library, or in the Zig standard library. 

**Frank Denis:**  We need a test suite, at very least test vectors to guarantee interoperability. A reference implementation would be nice, the wasmedge and wasmtime implementations are not very simple or readable in order to be fast.

**Frank Denis:**  with regard to wasi preview 2: the current spec and implementations are all in witx. We will need to create a wit version, which will also unblock support for streams. Supporting the new abi and getting more adoption [of the witx abi] are not mutually exclusive.

**Frank Denis:**  Next meeting is on April 4, 2023

**Bailey Hayes:** Is that a call to action, do you want a contributor for the wit version?

**Frank Denis:**  It is not as high priority, help would be really welcome on the other high priority things and then we can think about preview 2

**Bailey Hayes:** Kyle, did you get everything you needed out of that?

**Kyle Brown:** I look forward to seeing someone do the preview 2 work, and also the phase 2 of the spec process to get the spec text. Your approach makes sense.

#### Propose wasi-pattern-match

Discuss stage 0 consensus vote

https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/consensus.md

**Jianjun Zhu:** Reasons for proposing this api: server side wasm are scanning network packets, and http requests/responses, to detect abnormal traffic (WAF applications). These scans must be very fast so they dont impact user experience. There is ongoing work for hardware acceleration of pattern matching - new instructions, hardware offloading like GPU or other accelerators, which wasm cant use.

**Jianjun Zhu:** Goals are to support the PCRE syntax, or a subset. The API would be for iterating over matches, find first match, or check existence. The biggest goal is to improve upon current wasm performance. PCRE Is also used for string replacement, but that is not a goal for this proposal, we only want to focus on matching.

**Jianjun Zhu:** Here are some draft apis [see slides for the api text] - create a scanner from a list of patterns, scan a single block (pass a buffer), scan a stream which has a large payload across several blocks which supports matching across the end of one block onto the start of the next block. Then an api to retrieve matches from a scan result.

**Jianjun Zhu:** Here’s an example of the api, we’ll create a scanner, scan a block, check if it has a match, close the scanner.

**Jianjun Zhu:** Here’s an initial performance experiment of using this implemented in wasm, vs calling out to this wasi api. It is 1.5 to 2.5x faster in the wasi api.

**Pat Hickey:** PCRE is a very big spec, i’m skeptical that it is portable across many implementations.

**Jianjun Zhu:** There are some modes that do work across many languages, so we’ll start from those.

(discussion of whether we meet the requirements for a consensus vote, we do)

**Bailey Hayes:** we’ll do a consensus vote for phase 0, the consequences are that we create the repositories in git. Is anyone against this proposal? Nobody has noted that they are against, so this proposal moves to phase 0.
