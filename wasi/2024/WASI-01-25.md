** Bailey Hayes** Starting with going through the phase criteria - Vote to include in Preview 2 needs to have the proposal voted for inclusion of the world into the Preview once it has reached phase 3. This is a window for Preview 2 - this set is the launch set, more can be added after the launch until we launch the next Preview 3.

** Bailey Hayes ** We have reached phase 3 for two worlds. Here is the criteria we voted on for that at a previous meeting.

** Bailey Hayes ** We vote by consensus, following the wasm CG’s process. We are going to vote SF, F, N, A, SA.

** Bailey Hayes ** Wasmtime’s implementation status is complete for wasi:cli/command and wasi:http/proxy worlds. The only change since the phase 3 votes is that wasmtime now has more tests that pass.

**Guy Bedford ** JCO is a JavaScript implementation running on Node.js, by myself, Yosh Wuyts, and Wassim Chegham. Last meeting we had a little delay to work on the polling system, thanks Trevor Elliott for helping with that work.

**Guy Bedford** JCO now passes all of wasmtime’s tests on mac and linux. On windows it passes all except one (104/105). The failing test has to do with readonly directory behavior on windows. The CLI world works with `jco run` and the http world works with `jco serve`. We even have CPython working just as it does on wasmtime, as further demonstration that it is conformant.

**Bailey Hayes ** What does the launch criteria mean? Stability - there are two implementations that conform

**Bailey Hayes ** What does it mean for preview 3 to launch? Is the question in the chat. The question is asking about what the window means. Our goal with Preview 3 is support within the component model for native async - futures and streams. Preview 3 applications will be a breaking change and not run on Preview 2 runtimes.

**Pat Hickey ** Preview 3 will launch no sooner than 1 year from now

**Luke Wagner ** Before Preview 3 we can have minor releases in the Preview 2 family, with additive changes - new features that we can add, but not change any existing interfaces. Those releases can happen at a much faster cadence. We can add new proposals to preview 2 as part of those point minor releases.

**Bailey Hayes ** This is a feature of having versioned, modular interfaces, making those minor releases possible.

**Bailey Hayes ** The first vote we have is about the wasi-cli world. Here is its portability criteria. Wasmtime and JCO meet those criteria. We’ll now hold the vote where everyone can enter the 

**Till Schneidereit ** Adding to prev discussion, to clarify that preview 3 is additive because it extends what wit and the component model can do, rather than change the behavior of existing content for Preview 2. So, Preview 3 implementations will run Preview 2 programs.

** Dave Bakker ** Between preview versions, do we need to conform to backwards compatibility within wit itself? Or is an adapter module considered backwards compatible

** Bailey ** Its only additive - for streams we could add a new operation for forward splicing, but we cant change any existing methods on streams.

** Luke ** with preview 2 minor releases we can use the subtyping the component model already allows, which is adding new functions. 

Vote begins

SF: 24
F: 10
N: 1
A: 0
SA: 1

** Bailey Hayes ** We have confirmed the count. I declare consensus based on that vote, to include wasi:cli/command world in preview 2.
**Till Schneidereit ** We typically record the reasons an against voter votes against a proposal

** Syrus Akbary ** As I said in a previous meeting I dont believe that wasi cli is up to the state it should be in for termios, compared to other proposals

** Bailey Hayes ** Preview 2 allows for additive changes so we can add things to that world at a later date.

** Bailey Hayes ** Moving on to the next vote for wasi-http proxy world inclusion in WASI Preview 2. Wasi http has two implementations, again wasmtime and jco, and there are users running it in many contexts beyond those implementations - fermyon is consuming it, wasmcloud is as well, (notetaker adds: fastly is as well).

Vote Begins

SF: 23
F: 7
N: 4
A: 0
SA: 0

** Bailey Hayes ** We have confirmed the vote tally, that means we have consensus to include wasi-http in preview 2.

** Bailey Hayes ** Our last vote. The launch criteria is that two independent criteria define worlds, and all their dependencies have met the requirements for inclusion and the WASI subgroup has voted to launch it.

** Syrus Akbary ** In the bytecode alliance you have worked on wasmtime and jco, in wasmer we are behind. Have you thought about halting or waiting until wasmer implementation is done.

** Bailey Hayes ** We have reached phase 3 for a few months. What would be the value of holding the launch if your inclusion is fully additive, we already have two very different runtimes and met the criteria this preview 2. There are other runtimes working on implementations, Michael Yuan gave an update to this group on WasmEdge adding support for Preview 2, and we dont have motivation to hold the launch for other runtimes. If breaking changes turn out to be necessary based on feedback from other runtimes we have preview 3 to work on that.

** Guy Bedford ** On the jco side this is a collaboration with microsoft, in terms of implementation feedback we had a lot of very interesting discussions, from the implementor perspective we satisfied we answered all the questions that came up during our implementation.

** Till Schneidereit ** These are completely separate implementations that do not share code, and they are done by different sets of people, so we are not only conforming to the letter of the rules but also to the intent, which is to have different implementations vetting the design. If other groups have started later and are behind on implementing it, that is no reason to hold up.

** Bailey Hayes ** To reiterate what Robin said in chat, there are a lot of folks who need a point of stability to add Preview 2 support in their platforms and applications, and I don’t want to wait on that.

Vote Begins

SF: 25
F: 9
N: 0
A: 1
SA: 0

** Syrus Akbary ** I will choose against because of the wasmer thing.

** Bailey Hayes ** With that we have consensus to launch preview 2. Thank you everyone for putting the work in over years. This standard has taken a lot of different folks, we thanked a lot of people before break and put those in the notes and i’m certain that was not everyone, thank you all for putting in the effort.

** Pat Hickey ** I want to thank you all, this is a great community to be a part of and I’m proud of what we accomplished together.

** Till ** I want to thank Bailey and Pat for shepherding this process, and I think we are at a great place with a great set of specs and implementations, I look forward to many more implementations to come. This is a big moment for WASI and WebAssembly.
