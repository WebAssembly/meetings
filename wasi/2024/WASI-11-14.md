#### Discuss wasm32-wasip2-module proposal (Stephen Berard, 20 min)

Stephen: Luke presented this back in August, I want to discuss how to implement it and who is working on this

Stephen: Secondary to that, how do we support the component model in C and C++, today as far as I know mapping the canonical ABI to C is not defined

Chris: This is coming from the eSIG, “how do we migrate the embedded ecosystem to the component model?” Some showstoppers in the past: realloc, which starts to disappear in p3. eSIG is playing catch up. Should we prepare the toolchains for this beforehand? We’re also interested in Ben Titzer’s work on WALI; i.e., “could we implement WASI within WebAssembly and interface with the OS using WALI?”

Stephen: There is some work required to update tooling and in the runtimes; we’re willing to sign up for that but want to evaluate first.

Pat: Some suggestions: the canonical ABI is defined in terms of Wasm linear memory and core types in toolchains, by design. wit-bindgen is a popular implementation of the canonical ABI that you may be interested in looking at for C; collaborating there is a good path forward. No C++ support there; unknown what that would involve. Christoff Petig has done a lot of work on the C backend in wit-bindgen.

Stephen: One confusion is that authoring a component from C but hosting a component from C is not yet supported, right?

Pat: For host languages, this is left up to the runtimes–see wasmtime-wit-bindgen (Rust as the host language) and jco (JS as the host language). You should create a new repository for C as the host language and your given runtime.

Chris: Good estimate of cost.

Stephen: C++ could be handled by C bindings; native C++ objects… we’ll see. For Luke, what is the status of the wasm32-wasip2-module target? Who should we engage with?

Luke: Since then, I wrote up a proposal in the component model, build-targets.md. It’s been reviewed but, before we merge it, we need an implementation. Using the spec, Alex has made some progress but this is not done yet.

Stephen: Can I get some links to that work?

Luke: [in chat] https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/378

Chris: Is there anything that the eSIG can share more widely that would be useful? Was talking to Joel about async and some timing questions came up, e.g., swapping out the scheduler, prioritization. Worked through the ground work in the eSIG, attempting to come up with a coherent response to certain proposals. Also had some discussions re: shared memory with Deepti and Sean, some future questions about zero copy, etc. More than happy to help.

Stephen: We should share some of the topic lists created in the eSIG.

Chris: I’ll translate those into an issue to share more widely. Need tight integration with the host environment. Have feedback to give to proposals like: threads, async, stack switching, etc. “Can we auto-generate WIT from a C header file?” Interested in a zero copy implementation; how to do so safely? We’ve been trying to embed mmap into WAMR. These are examples of things coming soon from the eSIG pipeline.

Luke: On the GPU topic, have been talking to Deepti, Sean, etc. We want to be able to map regions of linear memory to somewhere else (e.g., separate process, device). Need some preparation but after that we have a streaming operation. Chrome has already worked on “BYOB” streams but has the detaching problem–level 1. One level up is to pass a prepared buffer to the stream operation to read or write–instead of passing bytes we pass indices to prepared buffers. This avoids some of the “wild west” shared memory problems.

Chris: This is an advantage of being in-person at WasmCon. Midokura has a use case for reading a DMA directly into linear memory.

Luke: A DMA is a copy engine; we need concrete C code where there is no copy involved.

Chris: Don’t want to punch a security hole in the sandbox.

Stephen: Dan may have an example. This is similar to the GPU example but in reverse.

Mendy: We are trying to make array buffers work on low-end devices–copy on every frame is too expensive. On those devices it may not make sense to copy.

Chris: [some comments about cost of implementation on smaller and smaller devices using USB]

Luke: There is a copy happening but it would be great to make that single copy directly into Wasm linear memory. In an example we worked through yesterday, a wasip2 example found that streams fixed the issue.

Chris: How about with multiple components?

Luke: Requires advanced optimizations, potentially changes to the core spec. We should start on lower tier problems first.

Bailey: Just bumped into Christoff Petig, he is going to look into Luke’s ideas.

Stephen: We should get this written up in some form of fashion.

Chris: [explaining Siemens use case again]
