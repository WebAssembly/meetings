### Notes

#### wasi-observe

**Chris Dickinson**: wasi-observe’s goal is to expose an interface to logging and metrics to wasi components. Stories listed in the wasi-observe repo. Whether DataDog or Honeycomb, should be able to integrate. Agnostic if this is implemented by the host or another component. Not opinionated about aggregation. Not opinionated about auto-instrumentation.

**Chris Dickinson**: Initial CFP. Had representatives from Fermyon and Cosmonic including Danielle and Brooks, as well as Walther who is unaffiliated. Other interested parties include Ralph from Microsoft and Ben from Dylibso. Meetings are fortnightly. Current state is that we have a WIT interface from a core module implementation of observability from the observe-SDK from dylibso. We are bringing in the wasi-logging effort. We are working with them to pull that interface in. We are going to build a context resource to anticipate multi-threading.

**Pat Hickey**: Phase 1 vote. Already happening in a private repo and this vote is to move to the WebAssembly org and list in the existing proposals there.

**Pat Hickey**: It doesn’t sound like there are any questions or contention around this one.

 **Pat Hickey**: Universal consensus vote. Any objections?

 **Pat Hickey**: Everybody is in favor. wasi-observe is now Phase 1.

#### WASI64

**Shengdun Wang**: When the API ends, they all assume the pointers and size of 32 bit. So you end up in a situation where you are not able to use WASI API’s in 64 bit. I tried some solutions. I maintain an existing virtual machine, abvm. I think the better solution is to duplicate all of the API’s to 64bit. A duplicate with suffix will not break anything. All of the plugins is trying to assume 32.
Demo implementation: https://github.com/trcrsired/wasi-libc/blob/main/libc-bottom-half/sources/__wasilibc_real.c

This demo uses a 64 bit suffix. 

 **Pat Hickey**: W3C meeting. W3C has a governance rule to protect IP. Sign the CLA. 

 **Pat Hickey**: Second piece of this puzzle in terms of ABI’s and interfaces is WITX. The changes is about WASI Preview 1. This is specified in WITX. This is a 4 year old way of doing things. This group has voted to move on from specifying things in WITX from WASI Preview 1 to WASI Preview 2. We voted to launch WASI Preview 2 in the last meeting. I am not in favor of extending WITX.

**Shengdun Wang**: The problem is that libc is required for this. Libc is a posix like ABI.

 **Pat Hickey**: Today we support libc with the component model adapter. There is work ongoing right now to add component-model support in libc. 

**Marcin**: WASI Preview 1 is 4 years old. Complete migration might not be possible with existing systems. It is not possible right now but not necessarily moving to preview 2 for various reasons. Is there a model here where we can have community level support for some of the features. Is there an option where a particular group can support this feature. Maintaining for the future. We have a business case to use 64.

**Bailey Hayes**: 

 **Pat Hickey**: It’s not about maintaining or contributing. It’s about the maintenance of all new features. It will make it very difficult for new things to develop of the new things that need to be developed on the component model. Increased work for folks are going to add it in this way that the spec is moving towards. I think we disagree on substantial point here. Should we add features to preview 1 or should we maintain focus on preview 2.

**Luke Wagner**: How many different folks are interested in adding to preview 1 in terms of fork and things. 

**Shengdun Wang**: I want to change code just in wasi-libc. Changes are just isolated to wasi-libc.

 **Pat Hickey**: The hosts would have to support it. Splinters support for WASI Hosts.

**Luke Wagner**: What is the quantity of people interested in toolchain and support for WASI Preview 1. 

**Marcin**: My team is dedicated and run a relatively large product on Preview 1. We have to maintain it. Once we migrate to preview 2, we will have no business case to keep maintaining.

**Shengdun Wang**: Preview 2 does not have a plan to support x64.

**Luke Wagner**: Actually that part is really is easy. If the memory index specifying by lifting and lowering.

**Shengdun Wang**: Plugins wouldn’t work. Still must be a suffix.

**Luke Wagner**: Yeah bigger challenge to get the target emitters to target 64. That doesn’t get to the WASI challenges. As far as how the component model can support 64, this is simple. If targets 64 bit then put in the right pointer. This is easy but changing the producer toolchain this fundamental challenge here.

**Marcin**: What is the preview 2 status compared to preview 1. It might take a preview 1 program. Is there a gap between preview 1 and preview 2?

**Marcin**: There is a component adapter that takes in core module and adapts it to preview 2.

 **Pat Hickey**: Joel Dice has work ongoing to do this in wasi-sdk. Less than a quarter away from all of that. This was awaiting the standard. [CD edit: link to the draft PR https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/449]

**Luke Wagner**: There is an adapter from preview 1 to preview 2.

**Marcin**: Is there an adapter to go from preview 2 to preview 1?

**Luke Wagner**: Not currently.

**Marcin**: Are there other people like me that are stuck on preview 1 for features like wasm-exception, threads, 64 memories.

**Sean Isom**: For what its worth, I use the preview2 adapter against code from wasi-sdk daily in C++ as part of my toolchain. No issues [CD edit: link to the preview 2 adapter, https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/crates/wasi-preview1-component-adapter, sean’s docs PR in progress: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs/pull/66]

**Pat Hickey**: The component model has a path forward for all of those things. Threads is under active development with several engineers. I don’t know the status on exceptions. I know that there are sketches and plans.


**Shengdun Wang**: LLVM is still using the old one. 

**Dan**: Exceptions are orthogonal to this conversation. Preview 1 did not have support for exceptions. The thing we need for exceptions is the standard to stabilize and for someone to write code.

**Pat Hickey**: As far as supporting the 64 bit proposal in the component model. It is imminently implementable. No longer a WASI concern, this is a component model concern.

**Dan**: To be clear about this, WASI has never supported exceptions.

**Marcin**: Moving back to memory in wasm 64 in the component model. Would it be enough to just implement the ABI’s in the host. I presume WASI libc operates on the ABI’s. Would that be an option and reasonable to you?

**Luke Wagner**: Yes, folks starting with a single module targeting the component model API. 

**Marcin**: Component model support in wasi-libc status?

**Pat Hickey**: PR for libc support https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/449 
 
**Pat Hickey**: You get type safety at the component model level. 

**Dave Bakker**: Supports everything in preview 1 plus sockets. Initial PR was too big and so next steps are to split them up. Another PR is opened up to use preview 2 to component model resources. The next step would be to use the sockets functionality, etc. Then slowly migrate over from preview 1 adapter straight to targeting preview 2 functions.

**Marcin**: It is under active development?

**Pat Hickey**: I don’t think there’s a way to make this work go faster where it is at now. 

**Shengdun Wang**: Does preview 2 use the component model?

**Pat Hickey**: Yes.

**Pat Hickey**: We need to end this discussion now and move to wasi-webgpu. 


#### wasi-webgpu

**Mendy Berger**: This is wasi-webgpu+ because this includes more than just wasi-webgpu. But that doesn’t give you the ability to render it anywhere. You need something to get it onto the screen. The point that you connect the canvas to the webgpu is a new context.

There is a question on if some of these should be broken out.
wasi-canvas: Canvas/surface
Wasi-graphics-context: Point of connection

This can mostly be based on the webgpu spec. I created a WebIDL converter. 

https://github.com/MendyBerger/webidl-wit

Not like canvas on the web. This is a very simple API. I expect this to take longer to standardize because we’re coming up with new API’s there. 

wasi-graphics-context is the connection between the webgpu and the canvas so that they don’t have to rely on the other. 

**Sean Isom**: Example of attaching a web canvas to webgpu via the context: https://github.com/MendyBerger/wasi-webgpu/blob/main/example-apps/triangle/src/lib.rs#L49

**Mendy Berger**: Should be usable with other graphics API’s in the future.

**Mendy Berger**: This is WIT for the wasi-graphics-context. Every GPU API would give you it’s type for what the next frame is going to be.

**Bailey Hayes**: Since the work is tightly coupled today, it makes sense to me to keep it in one repo for now

**Pat Hickey**: Later we can figure out if/how we should separate this out into a separate proposal. 

**Mendy Berger**: Sounds good.

**Sean Isom**: Should be useful for vector graphics since most of this is not gpu accelerated.

**Mendy Berger**: Cool so it will be useful.

**Syrus**: I don’t understand the need for a custom API. What is the delta that you are trying to cover?

**Mendy Berger**: Are you asking what the web api’s are?

**Syrus**: Why separate?
**Mendy Berger**: A new windowing/full windowing API would be useful for example. 

**Sean**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50819974/how-to-use-canvas-in-emscripten
Two different use cases. Raw image pixels for output from a raw rasterization process, vs Canvas which is a higher level context. Like this: https://web.dev/articles/drawing-to-canvas-in-emscripten

**Pat Hickey**: Universal consent vote. We’ll keep it all in one repo for now and may have future discussions later to split as appropriate. 

**Pat Hickey**: Ok this passes. 

**Pat Hickey**: We are now out of time and will see everyone next time.
