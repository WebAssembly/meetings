### Announcement, BA Plumber Summit Sept 26 & 27, 2024

**Pat Hickey** The Bytecode Alliance is holding a plumber’s summit for the Component Model and WASI collaboration event. This is not a WASI Subgroup event. It is an open invitation for folks who are working on implementations and related projects. 

**Pat Hickey** Look for a formal announcement next week. It will be held on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington. Similar to last fall’s Componentize the World event.

###  WASI 0.2.1 release retro

**Yosh Wuyts**: As planned, we put out a new WASI release last week. Let’s have a little moment of reflection and a brief recap.

**Yosh Wuyts**: Last Thursday, we held a little mini release party. Bumping versions and making sure releases happened. We merged Joel’s unstable feature in wasi-cli. 

**Yosh Wuyts**: On Friday, we published a blog post from the Bytecode Alliance describing the releases and plans. I hope going forward we can keep that practice going forward of having some other venue to write about it.

**Yosh Wuyts**: Nobody burned out. We did a release and we did an OK job managing that. Nothing major and no heroics involved, which is a good thing.

**Yosh Wuyts**: For 0.2.2, I would like to drive and include @deprecated in at least one API. A minor naming change in wasi-http.

**Bailey Hayes**: Let’s walk through the release artifacts and the process we used to create them.

Scratchpad we used for creating a WASI release: https://hackmd.io/@ricochet/Hyc1KzFF0/edit

Yosh wrote this great blog post about the release: https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/WASI-0.2.1

Wasmtime updating to use 0.2.1: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9063

Related issue: https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/608

**Andrew Brown**: The MIME type included in that OCI artifact says it’s Wasm. Is that a component?

**Taylor Thomas**: Yes. Within the CNCF Wasm WG, we came up with a format to standardize the OCI Artifact Layout: https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/wasm/deliverables/wasm-oci-artifact/

**Bailey Hayes**: These are WIT-only components. To see what I mean, run the following with the latest tools (install wkg from git):
```bash
wkg oci pull "ghcr.io/webassembly/wasi/io:0.2.1"
wasm-tools component wit webassembly_wasi_io.wasm
```

**Bailey Hayes**: We’ll continue the discussion online for ways to improve the process and automation. I may push for a monorepo for example to make the release process simpler.
