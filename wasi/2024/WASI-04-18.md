### New proposal: wasi-usb

https://github.com/Wadu436/wasi-usb

**Wouter Hennen** The proposal is to add wasi-usb to interact with USB devices on a low level, think libusb. For example webusb is implemented using libusb. It is universal - works on lots of platforms. The proposal would like to add something similar to libusb. I have been working on it with (missed name). We have a small but incomplete wit interface ready in our repo. Here is a function for enumerating available USB devices. One thing we’d like to add here is access control, so the program doesn’t have access to all devices by default.

**Bailey Hayes** Who are the champions?

**Wouter** Merlijn Sebrechts at imec is the champion

**Bailey Hayes** Here is the criteria for phase 1. There is general interest within the subgroup for this api, and the subgroup believes the api is in-scope and plausibly workable. Since this is similar to proposals such as WASI-I2C, I think we should do a unanimous consent vote to make this a phase 1 proposal. Does anyone feel this is not in scope for WASI?

#### Vote: Approve for Phase 1 wasi-usb

Unanimous consent vote

**Bailey** The unanimous consent vote has passed, since nobody has objections. I have other questions that are unrelated to phase 1 vote.

**Bailey** Have you considered the webusb proposal?

**Wouter** Webusb is more of an abstraction over libusb and our conclusion was that its preferable to be more like libusb because programs ported to WASI are likely to use libusb as a base for something similar

**Bailey** It looks like we can use the interface definitions you have and map them to webusb.

**Bailey** One of the key things you’ll need to do in phase 1 is define your portability criteria. One of those criteria might be whether it can be implemented using webusb in a web context.

**Merlijn** Asks for clarification - what do you mean by mapping to a web api?

**Bailey** Look at what Guy Bedford did in JCO - theres an example there where the WASI Filesystem interfaces are implemented using Node.js’s filesystem. There is JS glue that provides the mapping to the native Web api

**Merlijn** I wonder if we are making the abstraction too low level to make that happen. We wanted existing native applications able to use the api. But theres also the web side.

**Bailey** We can link you up with people that have worked with usb at the lower level and higher level

**Luke Wagner** re Webusb - we may find ourselves in a different security situation. Webusb wants to prevent drive-by attacks on user browsers. This is why Mozilla has taken a negative (no and never) position on. So Webusb is exposing usb to random web pages. In the WASI context for example If you are looking to implement a driver, you may have a totally different security posture. So it might be ok if WASI USB finds itself at a lower level of abstraction than Webusb.

**Bailey** Any other questions or comments before meeting ends

**Taylor Thomas** There are two WASI Cloud proposals we are getting ready to move to phase 2. WASI Runtime Config, and WASI Key-value.

- https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue

**Chris Woods** reminder that there is an ongoing discussion for an embedded SIG and its charter. There is a google doc for the charter. Ask me for the link to this document.

**Till Schneidereit** For clarity, I'm excited for this proposal and SIG but this is a Bytecode Alliance SIG, not a WASI SIG. It would be meant to feed into WASI activities as input but its not an official WASI activity, so that's just an announcement as an FYI to this group.

**Chris Woods** Good point, well made. Thank you Till. Link now in the chat, and added shortly to the notes.
