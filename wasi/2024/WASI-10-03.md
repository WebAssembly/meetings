### wasi-config update

**Taylor Thomas**: Serve as a call for implementations and looking for a vote soon for phase 3 and phase 2 for one of these.

**Taylor Thomas**: I will go through updates in the order that I think they will be stabilized. This currently says wasi-runtime-config, but we will rename to wasi-config. This interface is meant to configure whatever the guest component is running. You will see that the interface is very simple with 30 lines. Simple errors, a get, and a get-all.

This has been vetted by several people and is implemented in wasmCloud, Spin, and Wasmtime. This is currently in phase 2 and will likely move to phase 3 soon.

**Mossaka (in chat)**: For background on why we had `runtime` in the name: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config/pull/14#issuecomment-2344107573

**Mossaka (in chat)**: Champions including me, David and Dan, we agree to rename it to `wasi-config`.

### wasi-keyvalue update

**Taylor Thomas**: This is meant to be the 80% use-case across environments. 

**Taylor Thomas**: We have added compare-and-swap interface. There are a few outstanding issues including iterating over keys. In terms of interfaces, we have store, batch, atomic, and watch. Not all of these interfaces are required to be implemented and this is why they are separated into their own interfaces.

In terms of implementations, wasmCloud has implementations for redis, couchbase (created by couchbase), and NATS. Spin is also actively working on adopting these interfaces.

**Kate Goldenring**: For both WASI config and WASI kv, does the interface prescribe expected key syntax / casing? Why if one host interface expects alphanumeric camel case and another expects alpha only snake case?

**Taylor Thomas**: I can go either way on that. Most value stores support any type of key so I would not prescribe anything specific.

**Kate Goldenring**: The expectation is that you should accept any string or you should explain that to your users.

**Taylor Thomas**: Yes

**David Justice**: Do you perceive needing different format needs per different implementation.

**Kate Goldenring**: Yes in Spin, it is opinionated. It needs to be alphanumeric, kebab-case.

**David Justice**: We are still working on these. Always please give feedback to figure out how we can do even better.

**Taylor Thomas**: Kate I was thinking in terms of KV. For config, we could add something to the docs. Kebab and snake have both been seen as acceptable. 

**Kate Goldenring**: I created an issue for making errors more clear. https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config/issues/18

**Luke Wagner (in chat)**: For reference, wasi-http is very careful about specifying the allowed syntax of, e.g., header name strings and provides predictable portable syntax-error return values.

**Taylor Thomas**: Versions are free so we can iterate. Adding in an error like that is a good thing to add. Please PR this one in and I agree that the host needs the ability to express the intent and syntax requirements to the guest.

### wasi-blobstore update

**Taylor Thomas**: This one will be moving to phase 2 soon and hopefully to phase 3 not too long after. This one has had updates recently, all of these interfaces are standalone. The big key here is the container interface. One thing we are planning to do is smoosh blobstore and container interfaces together because you likely would never use one without the other. In wasmCloud we have S3 compatible, Azure Blobstore, and Filesystem. This will likely be the last one out of the updates that we’ve given to move forward to phase 3. 

**Taylor Thomas**: We’re looking forward to adding new worlds. The next release of WASI, it would be great to show that we are able to add new worlds. 

**Mossaka**: One more update to add on the wasi-cloud-core repo. I have a change to drop the wasi-sql proposal from the wasi-cloud-core world. The reason is that it is not being actively worked on and we are not sure on the portability. https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cloud-core/pull/15

### wkg and OCI packaging

**Taylor Thomas**: How do I get interfaces and where are these standard interfaces located? We have wit-deps that was created as a stop-gap and also copy-pasting which is not great. 

**Taylor Thomas**: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools

**Taylor Thomas**: This is the CLI. There are also crates that you can use. Wkg has a couple different commands. You can get and publish specific things in addition to the wit command. It is basically copied from cargo component (and will be removed from cargo component).

**Taylor Thomas**: This allows you to create a OCI artifact for a WIT package based on the spec that we created as part of the CNCF Wasm WG. 

**Taylor Thomas**: In a wit folder, you have your normal world.wit. Within your world, you have all of your dependencies enumerated. Wkg is configurable to support multiple registries.

**Taylor Thomas**: A wit package is a Wasm binary that purely contains the WIT. Running `wkg wit build`, this will create the Wasm binary. This can be embedded as a Rust crate. I have not done the work to provide FFI for other languages yet.

**Taylor Thomas**: This will make it possible to use with other languages with Go. I am also working on embedding this in wash CLI now. This fetching is automatic so it makes it easy and transparent. 

**Mossaka**: When you say “expect language toolchains to support this (wkg)”, do you expect language package managers like npm, go, pypi to support them?

**Taylor Thomas**: It depends what each language wants to do at build time.

### Announcements

**Sean Isom**: We would like to move wasi-webgpu forward to phase 2 in the next meeting. Please give us your feedback and thoughts!
