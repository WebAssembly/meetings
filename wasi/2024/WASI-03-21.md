### Proposal to add TLS interface to wasi-sockets

**Joel Dice**: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C55ph_fSTRhb4A4Nlpwvp9JGy8HBL6A1MvgY2jrapyQ/edit?usp=sharing

**Joel Dice**: 
TLS: Transport Layer Security (AKA SSL)
Wasi:sockets is a part of WASI 0.2
TCP and UDP (client and server)
DNS client
Vision: Bring your own DB/RPC/messaging/etc libraries. 
Goal: 80% compatibility with most client libraries
Problem: Most modern libraries and apps that use sockets also use TLS, which WASI does not (yet) support
WASI Python does not include SSL module
Option 1: Compile a TLS lib to Wasm (ex. openssl-wasm)
Pros: works today
Cons:
Vulnerable to side channel attacks
No CT WASI yet
No hardware acceleration
Statically linking TLS/crypto libs is problematic, ie requires labor intensive updates
Option 2: Use wasi-crypto
Pros:
Addresses side channel attacks
Can be hardware accelerated
Cons:
Unlikely to happen
Modifying OpenSSL, etc to use it is impractical
Lots of work, requiring special expertise
Not supported by upstream maintainers -> likely requires forking
Static linking still awkward
Option 3: Define a WASI interface for TLS
Pros:
Addresses side channel attacks
Can be hardware accelerated
No static linking, since host provided
Less work than option 2
Cons:
Libraries using OpenSSL directly would need to be ported (like almost everything in WASI)
More work than option 1
Proposal: wasi:sockets/tls
API modeled after Rustâ€™s native-tls crate
Higher level of abstraction than wasi-crypto
Rationale:
Portable from a host implementation perspective
Nicolas Devillard: MbedTLS might be worth looking at https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls


### WASI Embedded Ecosystem Introduction and Requirements

**Chris Woods**:
Requirements:
Continued WASI-Preview 1 Support
WASI-SDK tooling
WIT -> WITx
Threading, Sockets /Networking
Validation of the Component Model for Embedded Systems
Reliable and deterministic
Performance equivalent to P1
Embedded Innovation
I2C /GPIO/ SPI Interface definition
Multiple memories
There are millions of individual devices running WAMR
Amazon, Xiaomi, etc
Hardware -> RTOS -> WAMR -> Wasm applications
All but wasm applications are locked in due to embedded hardware lifecycle, especially for safety critical systems
WASI/WASM sits in a sweet spot between 340kb - 16 mb. Docker dominates above 16mb.
NFRs: Component model raises concerns about:
host to wasm latency
Unnecessary memory copies
Unnecessary data transformations
No embedded runtime for Preview 2.
Need: wit -> witx bindings so that WAMR can be used
Need: backport of preview 2 networking interface
