### I2C implementation 

**Friedrich Vandenberghe**

Running implementations

https://github.com/Zelzahn/wasi-i2c

**Bailey Hayes**: Microcontroller might be a bit vague in the proposal

**Chris Woods**: Let’s have a definition of this

**Friedrich Vandenberghe**: Raspberry Pi Pico

**Robin Brown**: ESP32

**Till Schneidereit**: is a Cortex M0+ too big?

**Emily Ruppel**: M0+ is one of the smallest ARM configuration. Which microcontroller might not be the right way to frame, instead we could focus on which OS. Perhaps WAMR or Zephyr

**Thomas Trenner**: Zephyr is reasonable.

**Stephen Berard**: I think we should likely select a few reference platforms and agree on OS/board/HW config. We should agree on a Dev board, OS, and HW configuration. Should be something small, much smaller than Cortex A53.

**Friedrich Vandenberghe**: Will file Github issue. Define portability criteria. See https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-i2c/pull/5

**Bailey Hayes**: Is there a use case proposal?

**Thomas Trenner**: UART and similar spaces

**Bailey Hayes**: Let’s keep the discussion going in the Github issue.

**Till Schneidereit**: Since at least some of these microcontrollers have the option to run without one: would people see it as a requirement to run without an MPU as well?

**Ralph Squillace**: Matrix of platforms, OSes, and configurations would be useful.

**Robin Brown**: Github discussions might be better suited than an issue.

**Bailey Hayes**: The proposal champions will decide if they will use discussions or issues. Decision to delay the vote until portability criteria is defined.
