### WASI 0.2.1

**Yosh Wuyts**: Two small updates to share today. The first is that as it comes for WASI 0.2.1 the release is set for next Thursday. We seem to be on track for that and nothing particularly interesting is still outstanding.

**Yosh Wuyts**: I originally suggested that wasi-clocks timezone support could be part of WASI 0.2.1. We received feedback on wasi-clocks timezone feature and we will have that as unstable going into WASI 0.2.1. The only feature we’re going to have for WASI 0.2.1 is the @since feature gates. We seem to be on schedule for that.

**Colin Murphy**: ECMA. The group that made the spec for JS for clarification. Are we saying we’re going to hold off putting it in wasmtime? No landing of timezones in wasmtime. We also need to add @deprecated.

**Yosh Wuyts**: My understanding of the JS group (ECMA), they have given us feedback for wasi-clocks. We were making assumptions about what UNIX does vs the decisions made for browsers. We need to navigate the existing unstable feature for timezones, and then also need to consider and answer feedback for the current wasi-clocks interface.

**Yosh Wuyts**: For WASI 0.2.1, this is just adding additional annotations for WIT.

**Colin Murphy**: The existing implementation for wasi-clocks and timezone was very chronos/rust specific.

**Yosh Wuyts**: I think it’s really great that we got feedback from world experts on this and that it could make it easy to run in browsers.

**Taylor Thomas (in chat)**: Community feedback ftw

**Pat Hickey**: Are there new features?

**Yosh Wuyts**: Just at @since

**Pat Hickey**: And we also have many updates to documentation. This sounds good to me and this is what we’re meant to be doing.

**Yosh Wuyts**: Also we’re going to be doing this manually for this release to see what it takes to automate.

### @deprecated gates have landed in WIT

**Yosh Wuyts**: We’ve added @since and @unstable. Now we are adding and have landed implementations for a new annotation, @deprecated.

**Yosh Wuyts**: @deprecated takes a required version field. This will enable us in future releases, probably 0.2.2 in wasi-http for a rename that we want to do. For wasi-clocks, we’re getting feedback from experts for renames/replaces that we may want to take. This will allow us to do this in the 0.2.x timeframe to make changes without breaking anything. Then in 0.3.x timeframe, we can remove the deprecated things.

**Yosh Wuyts**: I encourage you to read the WIT documentation for that and ask any questions. https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/377

## WebIDL to WIT converter

Mendy Berger: WebIDL to WIT converter. Guy Bedford got first-class support in JCO. Please collaborate and join us if you think it’s interesting. Links to chat and review:

- [Jco: WebIDL support & browser test suite](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/471)

**Luke Wagner:** This project is really cool. This makes it so that you have the entire browser API available to you.
