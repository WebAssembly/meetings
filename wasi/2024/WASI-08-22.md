### discuss moving wasi-nn to phase 3

**Andrew Brown**: wasi-nn currently at phase 2, we aren’t holding a vote today to go to phase 3, just want to discuss what it takes to get to a vote.

**Andrew** wasi-nn was initially proposed in 2020, I implemented it in Wasmtime, others implemented it in WasmEdge and WAMR, have a list of interested parties and contributors in my slides, have an informal working group in Bytecode Alliance. 

**Andrew** We did the big change from the preview 1 ABI to the preview 2 WIT definition. And we have some changes to the architecture.

**Andrew** Wasmtime has an implementation of the WITdefinition, WasmEdge has an implementation of preview 1 definition, WAMR is working on wasip2 module abi implementation

**Andrew** During the phase we have met one or more implementations to prototype the API, and we are working on the portability criteria. We’ll discuss that plan in a few slides. The ML Working Group has been meeting since Oct 2023, if you want to join those meetings every other Monday that's how we have been gathering feedback, we have notes online as well.

**Bailey (in chat)**: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/tree/main/machine-learning

**Andrew** I'd like to ask for phase 3 acceptance in Q4 of this year. It depends on the portability criteria plan. Here are the previous portability concerns brought up:

**Andrew** Its hard to test wasi-nn. If we are testing the internal model functionality we are getting out of scope of what WASI can describe, it varies widely in the many implementations. The other problem is that the user of wasi-nn just provides the binary bytes of a model, there are many ML frameworks and they change over time (Onnx has many versions, openvino has many versions etc), new frameworks being added too. So the question is how do you interpret those bytes.

**Andrew** My proposed plan is: 1. We need a test suite based on an “echo” model. If you pass in a tensor you get back the same tensor. This can test the API surface without testing the ML frameworks themselves.  2. We need to get rid of the current `load` and replace it with `load-by-name`, bump up the level of abstraction (which is already in the spec) and eliminate the old way of loading models. We have to resolve some changes: we are considering a prompt extension for LLMs, and error shape. So if we do all those things I propose we vote on phase 3 in Q4 of 2024, and then update implementations in 2 engines.

**Pat** Does the implementations happen before or after the vote

**Andrew** There is no requirement to have the implementations complete before the vote

**Pat** the way we handled that last time with e.g. wasi-http was we said Wasmtime is fully passing all tests and jco is passing 6/10. The requirement is left ambiguous because context matters but we were looking for “the end is within reach” of the 2nd implementation rather than “we don't know whether we will ever get to the end”

**Andrew** Ok then let's move that step up before the vote.

**Andrew** On the test suite: challenges include small floating-point differences between ML frameworks and parameters. Some of the models rely on randomness. There's many frameworks, many models, and many values, which is a really large space to test. We debated “if you can run this model x, that's the test suite” but there is no one model that runs in all the frameworks and how would we pick just one. So let's just test the wasi-nn api itself, and not test the internals of the ML model logic. So we have this idea of an echo model and the before and after tensor are identical, that can be mechanically checked for equality. We can explore all of the different tensor item types. So this would test that the wiring and logic between a wasi-nn interface and the framework implementation are working.

**Andrew** to address previous concern of loading by bytes, the graph encoding list is never complete, the encoded bytes are opaque, retrieving the bytes is slow because the models are really big so most users dont want to use that mode anyway, some of the models dont even fit in a wasm32 linear memory. The previous solution we proposed was to replace the `load` with `load-by-name` which is a higher level of abstraction where the implementation is responsible for having a model available. Load gives a lot of really low-level control of where the model runs on physical resources and things like that. So the idea we have is to eliminate load and rename load-by-name to load - make that the only abstraction available.

**Andrew** Error design. A PR for tensor residence (cpu, gpu?) which some frameworks support and some do not, and in our latest abstraction I feel like we do not need that - it's opaque to the user in the load-by-name api. Coalesce tensor parameters: first we setup the inputs, then run, then retrieve the outputs in separate calls. PR 77 makes compute a single function call, it's a function from list of named tensor to result of list of named tensor, error. This would simplify the implementation side to not have to hold state between calls. And we have had several requests to configure models by tweaking parameters, so there's a PR for listing the parameter names and then you can get and set them by names. Finally a prompt interface, currently you have to do a ton of work in the wasm side to make prompts work, so this proposal says to put that over in the implementation where you have a string to string compute, this is what LLMs and their users expect. This means there's 2 paths in the wasi-nn spec, either there's a graph to use with tensors or a graph to use with LLMs.

**Andrew** I want process feedback, and help on resolving all these problems, I'm on Zulip if you want to ping me to help. 

**Pat** I want to hear from the stakeholders who are interested in deploying this interface that they're all happy with how these questions are resolved. I don’t know if all of the representatives from those stakeholders are on this call to tell us they are happy with the state of this proposal

**Bailey** If they cant do it live on this call they can provide that sort of endorsement async on github

**Andrew** Meeting for 2 years we have collected a lot of that feedback. It’s not clear to those who are gathered here now because it's in many issues and PRs. 

**Pat** So I'd suggest that you resolve these outstanding questions and then make a github issue on wasi-nn saying motion to move to phase 3, and collect an endorsement and objection from a large majority of your stakeholders before bringing it to the WASI subgroup for a vote.

### Announcements

**Pat** Bytecode Alliance component model plumber summit is happening sept 26-27 in Redmond Washington, email me pat@moreproductive.org or David Bryant david@bytecodealliance.org to get more information. This event is for Bytecode Alliance implementers and users to collaborate in-person and remotely. A public invitation will happen soon.
