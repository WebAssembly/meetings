## Discussion and Vote: Advance wasi-i2c proposal to Phase 2

**Friedrich** Presentation on wasi-i2c vote for phase 2. It's the second time we are here. We took feedback on our portability criteria last time - it was too vague. We came up with a more specific set of criteria. We have three operating systems, architectures, and reference hardwares - an exact device. We also added some constraints on how much RAM on the board we are allowing implementations to use, to make sure there is some available for applications. With these changes I believe all our feedback had been answered sufficiently for a vote.

**Bailey** You’ve already created one implementation, correct?

**Friedrich** I have created an implementation for Rasphery Pi 3 Model B. Maximilian from Siemens has created an implementation for Nucleo F412ZG that is not public, but hes working on it.

**Bailey** Implementations are not required for this phase but its good to see they are underway.

**Bailey** I saw discussion on github about the wit interface. That doesn’t have to be finalized for this phase, that should continue taking implementation feedback.

**Pat**: We are going to hold a unanimous consent vote. Please register your dissent now.

**Pat**: No dissent

**Pat**: wasi-i2c passes to phase 2.
