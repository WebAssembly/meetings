### Long-term support for WASIp1 WebAssembly/WASI#595 (35 min)

**Marcin Kolny**: Summarizing context of WASI#595 

**Marcin Kolny**: Not interested in extending the spec itself. Interested in getting the tooling to support long-term support. We want it extended to support wasm64. The reason we need extended support is that we have a lot of devices that have the devices with the firmware baked into the runtime. We have to stay on this for as long as the customers have these devices.

**Marcin Kolny**: Mem64 requires updating the runtime. We don’t want to update to P2 yet. It may or may not change and there may be more backward incompatible changes. We want to stick to P1 to avoid additional fragmentation. Another reason is that mem64 is close to completion in the runtime we use, WAMR. Support for this in P2 is going to take more time. 

**Marcin Kolny**: I know that other folks have similar challenges so we started looking into solutions.

**Marcin Kolny**: The first was proposed by I think Andrew Brown. It would be to keep support for p1. I expect this will make this a little more difficult in adding changes to P2 and forward. SLA to address CI and keep this maintained.

**Marcin Kolny**: Preview 2 to Preview 1, I think is an excellent idea. But I found a problem that it is difficult with our code to address that preview 2 API’s are not called or eliminated so that new code does not accidentally unintentionally call unresolved symbols. Bailey mentioned tooling that is being built for transitioning 0.2.0 to 0.2.1. 

**Marcin Kolny**: My recommendation is that we move forward with both proposals. When we ever get to a point that we are satisfied with the adapter and have high confidence, then we will consider dropping the aforementioned p1 maintenance. 

**Ayako (in chat)**: Until wasi-threads is supported in p2, we must also stay in p1. so I guess we must follow you.

**Marcin Kolny**: If anyone else is interested or has a similar problem, please contact me. And this will be an upcoming topic in the Bytecode Alliance special interest group.

**Robin Brown**: This continued support will require maintainer work. Are the people who need this and are asking us to commit to it going to provide resources to do it?

**Marcin Kolny**: Yes, as long as we need this support, we will maintain it. We should agree on SLA’s. 

**Marcin Kolny**: Our priority in addition to supporting our use-cases, we do not want to block WASI progress. So if we don’t respond to CI for a couple weeks for example, maintainers should be able to disable the CI.

**Taylor Thomas**: Let’s make sure we don’t unintentionally fragment the ecosystem by holding on for too long. 

**Marcin Kolny**: We already have devices that run for 6-7 years so we must hold support for a long time.

**Marcin Kolny**: There might be some corner cases so we will need to evaluate.

**Bailey Hayes**: Agree we should keep maintenance on wasip1 going.

**Bailey Hayes**: Request to keep a feedback loop with new incoming changes so that we know the new designs work well for your use case.

**Marcin Kolny**: Adaption to p1 to p2 is much easier because its a lot easier to go to the superset. Going backwards is much harder.

**Nick Fitzgerald (in chat)**: I am in favor of the approach that Luke outlined in the issue thread

**Marcin Kolny**: If the adapter approach works, then I have no interest in maintaining wasi-libc for p1.

**Marcin Kolny**: We will explore the adapter further; in case it’s not viable or it’ll take longer, we’ll work on the wasi-libc preview1 support and add features like memory64 or exception handling. We will move forward with both approaches 

**Stephen Berard**: Related to the last topic.  I'm fairly new to this group.  As there any resources regarding what needs to be done when migrating from 0.1 --> 0.2?

### Discussion and Vote: Advance wasi-keyvalue and wasi-runtime-config proposals to Phase 2

**Taylor Thomas**: These are cloud resources not necessarily system resources. These are not exactly the same bucket of the previous ones.

**Taylor Thomas**: github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue

**Taylor Thomas**: Some of these will be implemented into hosts but I don’t expect this to be necessarily baked into wasmtime or other runtimes. 

**Taylor Thomas**: For the portability criteria, the implementations will be host plugins.

**Taylor Thomas**: We believe the best way to test this will be in the wasi test repo. This will be an optional section of the suite alongside the more system wasi type tests. We haven’t written the test suite yet. But will do so as part of the next phase.

**Taylor Thomas**: We have been working on this with Fermyon, Microsoft, and from the wasmCloud side (Cosmonic). We have boiled this feedback down to the interface that is in this repo. Joe, did I miss anything in regards to the portability criteria I should add in? (No)

**Taylor Thomas**: We have an implementation of this in wasmCloud and this is ready for implementation by others.

**Bailey Hayes**: Vote to phase 2

** Taylor Thomas ** Lets move on to wasi-runtime-config. This is for multitenant systems that may not expose environment variables. One of the implementations we are working on is with wasi-virt, which can expose runtime config as environment variables, or vice versa, depending on the applications needs. This can be used by databases and [missed examples], and provided by runtimes like wasmtime, wasmcloud, and spin. The portability criteria is that it should be provided on all the operating systems and provided by many providers. This is a collaboration across multiple runtimes. We already have an implementation in wasmcloud.

https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config/tree/main

** Dave Bakker** Whats the added value compared to virtualizing environment variables?

**Taylor Thomas** Multitenant systems require that we never expose or target environment variables. Semantic difference between environment variables, secrets, and types of configuration that may be configured at runtime.
[notetaker missed discussion about secrets]. 

**Taylor Thomas** Several community members have collaborated. In the WebAssembly WG in the CNCF, Danielle from Fermyon. Eyes from the CNCF Wasm WG.

**Bailey Hayes**: wasi-runtime-config advances to phase 2

**Taylor Thomas** If you are an implementer, please implement and give feedback.

**Joe**: Repo for wasi-cloud wasi-cloud: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cloud-core. wasi-cloud-core is a proposal for a world that includes the other worlds including wasi-runtime-config and wasi-keyvalue and other world proposals.
