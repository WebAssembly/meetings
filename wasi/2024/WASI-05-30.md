## Leveraging the @since and @feature gates in WASI
[Presentation](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/wasi/2024/presentations/2024-05-30-yosh-wuyts-leveraging-since-unstable-gates-in-wasi.pdf)

**Yosh Wuyts**: Hello, I’m Yosh, I work at microsoft.

**Yosh Wuyts**: @since and @feature gates have landed on the Component Model [https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/332](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/332)

**Yosh Wuyts**: I have prepared a little presentation for this that’s really two presentations in a trenchcoat.  

**Yosh Wuyts**: First I want to talk first about the mechanics of @since and @unstable and check in, then talk about how it applies to WASI itself. The question is how do we keep evolving WASI between major (breaking) versions. We already know many things we want to ship - changes to wit documentation, bug fixes, in-progress worlds we want to add, and evolving existing worlds/proposals. One example is we want to add timezone support to WASI clocks. We took that support out right before shipping 0.2.0, but we want to ship it in a future version.

**Yosh** First we are worrying about making it mechanically possible to extend existing wit documents. We want to do that without making complete copies of the spec for each separate version, so that we have a single document for the spec. 

**Yosh ** [webassembly/component-model#332](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/332) is the PR for this feature to wit. <shows an example>.
**Yosh ** The expected workflow, we start extending an existing document with an unstable feature-gate. Once we feel confident something should be stable, we change the @unstable to a @since, and give it a version, and the feature name can remain if we want. And at some point we could choose to remove the feature from the since gate.

**Yosh** importantly, @since and @unstable do not have any runtime semantics of components. You can think of them as a compile time macro only. Here’s an example where our tool has a spec that is at version 1.1.0, but your tool could choose that it’s only ready to implement version 1.0.0, so by evaluating these since annotations it can interpret the spec as it existed at 1.0.0. Or when you are ready to upgrade here’s the spec as it exists at 1.1.0. We think this is a much better alternative to git history.

**Robin** Is there a tool somewhere that takes this wit and filters it down to what the document was at some version?

**Yosh** We have an implementation in wasm-tools but I don’t know if it specifically supports that translation. Maybe Alex can give a better answer.

**Zalim, and andrew brown, and colin** Are you going to add @deprecated, to subtract something from an interface

**Yosh** @deprecated is not part of this proposal. For example we had a bug in wasi-http where we accidentally used the wrong term for a variant name, and we wish we could change it. So maybe that’s a motivating reason to pursue @deprecated in the future. But right now that’s not in scope. We can tackle adding @deprecated later.

**Yosh** these are the first attributes we have added to the wit language, so we had to define the mechanism to do that. Now we have a mechanism to add more attributes when we need to.

**Robin** what about the translation of wit to a binary, and back to wit - does that preserve this information? There are flows like registries where we store the binary encoding of the wit.

**Yosh** the components themselves do not encode the gates, the gates are compile tools only.

**Luke** I think this may work like documentation - we will need to encode it in a custom section in the component, so it can be put back in later.

**Syrus** features with dependencies can get convoluted. Do you have examples of how features work with interfaces and dependencies?

**Yosh** In the next section I will cover more of that. In general the gates can be applied to any item, just not fields of records or variants. I have an example of how this will work in the next part of my presentation.

**Yosh** Let’s talk about applying it to the WASI specs. Here is WASI clocks as it exists today at 0.2.0. We would like to add a timezone interface, which looks like this - two functions and a record. Pretty minimal additive change.

**Yosh** The process defined in [webassembly/wasi#605](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi/pull/605) says that extensions/additions need to independently advance through the phase process, starting with Phase 0. I filed a PR yesterday that says here’s the clocks timezone proposal starting at Phase 0, to start that process. So, here are the gates I’m adding to the wit that says unstable for feature clocks-timezone. We can bikeshed the exact name elsewhere. So here’s the model of how when the phase advances, they can be released in 0.2.1 by changing the unstable to a since.

**Yosh** Right now nothing in the WASI specs is documented with what version it was introduced, it’s just all at 0.2.0. So right now we are considering what forward compatibility will look like. We could tag (for example) wasi-random with @since(version = 0.2.0). Then if we update wasi-random package to 0.3.0 as part of a future release, we can leave those since tags in and tools now know that any wasi-random that was compiled for old (0.2.0) versions will work directly on the new 0.3.0 interface. So this is a documentation of forward compatibility.

**Yosh** Here is a case from [webassembly/wasi-http#115](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/pull/115). We are talking about how wasi-http defines a world which has an include wasi:clocks/imports@0.2.0. So what if we upgrade the package wasi:http@0.2.1. We could still include clocks at 0.2.0. Or we could now explicitly do an import of wasi:clocks/monotonic and wall clock at 0.2.1, so we are depending on the most recent version of those interfaces but not pulling in the new timezones interface, because maybe proxies shouldn’t have time zones.

**Syrus** what are the edge cases in this proposal, anything you haven’t covered here

**Yosh** Transient dependencies that you accidentally end up exporting more than you intend to, because the underlying clocks dependency changes and you end up re-exporting more, that can take people off guard so it’s something to think about. Robin also mentioned a good one about preserving this information in the binary encoding. So I’m presenting here so we help surface these things. I think the basic shape of this is OK but as we apply it we will learn more.

**Yosh** I added gates to literally everything in the entire WASI api and added gates for timezone and tried it with the tooling, and it all worked with the latest wasm-tools. Alex wrote a lot of tests inside wasm-tools as well.

**Syrus** Let’s say you have a function with a since gate on future version 0.2.1, and its using a new type that’s not available in 0.2.0 and is in the new version 0.2.1 spec, but only the function has the since gate, is the type suddenly available in 0.2.0.

**Yosh** You can add since gates on the types as well. You can add since gates to entire type definitions. You cannot add them to specific fields of records or variants of enums. We may pursue doing that in the future but we aren't yet.

**Syrus** capnproto has a good article on additive fields in interfaces. [https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-optional](https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-optional)

**Robin** Can we apply gates to interfaces?

**Yosh** Yes, every item is supported, everywhere you'd expect it to work it does work with the exception of fields and variants that I covered.
